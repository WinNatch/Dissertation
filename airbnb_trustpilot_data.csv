2025-07-09,1,Extremely Poor Customer Service and No Compensation for Serious Damages,"I am shocked and deeply disappointed by the way Airbnb has handled my recent damage claim.

After my last guest urinated on my mattress and caused extensive damage to my parquet floor (which now requires sanding of an entire 100m² area), as well as broke two cupboards, I submitted full documentation, including professional assessments, invoices, videos, and photos. Despite this, I have been repeatedly contacted by different customer service agents who clearly do not read the case history. Each one asks the same questions over and over again, and no one takes ownership of the issue.

I requested a direct phone call from a supervisor or department manager – not just another generic email from a new agent. This has been ignored completely.

I am an attorney and fully aware of Airbnb’s policies. I have complied with all of them, yet they continue to delay my case with irrelevant replies and automated scripts. Meanwhile, I have been forced to sleep on the floor for weeks and cannot rent out my place due to the unresolved damage.

This level of customer support is unacceptable and unprofessional for a global platform like Airbnb. Their handling of this case is not only negligent – it feels deliberately obstructive.

Unless Airbnb resolves this matter and compensates me fairly, I will continue to share this experience across social media and legal channels. I have never encountered such poor support from a major tech company."
2025-07-09,1,Charged for damages on a rental that we…,"Charged for damages on a rental that we did not cause, no support from Airbnb despite proving 3 other companies had access to the condo after us, and the management company had a poor reputation and had been accused of fraudulent practices. Airbnb continued to say we were responsible. I will never use this company again , beware"
2025-07-09,1,Thieving scum,"Thieving scum, they take pre authorisation and when host doesn’t confirm waiting over 30 days for money to be returned.

Holding thousands from my account. Avoid this company. "
2025-07-09,1,This was hands-down one of the worst…,"This was hands-down one of the worst experiences I’ve had with Airbnb — for a week-long stay that cost us £912. The property was filthy, damaged, and completely misrepresented, with outdated photos that clearly no longer reflect its actual condition. We left within minutes of arriving — it was that bad.

We clearly explained everything and requested a refund. The host ignored us, and Airbnb brushed it off, hiding behind policy and refusing to take any real accountability. No inspection, no follow-up, no support. Just an easy win for the host, and a complete loss for us — even with travel insurance in place.

Airbnb now seems more interested in protecting dishonest hosts than standing by its guests. If someone cancels in good faith for valid reasons, and Airbnb offers zero protection or action, then why should anyone feel safe booking through the platform?

Truly disgraceful customer service. I will never trust Airbnb again, and I strongly urge others to think twice before handing over your money to a system that clearly doesn’t protect you."
2025-07-09,1,Liars and inept customer care,"Company fails to follow their own policy.

I stayed at a property where there was rampant black mould and dripping from the ceiling left giant puddles on the kitchen tiles, making it slippery and dangerous. The listing and host did not indicate any of those issues. I photographed the issues, and contacted Airbnb to make them aware and seek compensation.

After many hours of making my points, on chat and calls, I kept getting useless blanket responses as a way of evading their responsibility of care.

Do not trust this company, and if you have alternative to find accommodation, I recommend you take it."
2025-07-09,1,Delayed payment ,Disappointed with Abnb
2025-07-09,1,We have had a shocking experience with…,"We have had a shocking experience with the host of The filey beach retreat.  Left the property cleaned and tidy and get home to an email stating that damages to the property for £125.00 an apparent urine smell on the rug and 2 throws which now have been replaced. Apparently we took a gerbil with us on holiday which caused the urine smell. How are we meant to prove that this is all a lie!?! Good luck with booking an airbnb property in future, because the host will say anything for extra cash! "
2025-07-09,1,If I could give zero I would,"If I could give zero I would. We we deceived by the people renting a property, who gave clear promises in writing about the conditions of the property including assurances that concerns had been addressed. Blatant lies, we have written evidence and will seek legal action. The flippant refusal to assist from AirBNB means I’ll never use their so called services again"
2025-07-09,1,Airbnb allows RAPISTS to host,The host entered the apartment while I was outside and my girlfriend was having a shower. I contacted Airbnb support and said it was urgent and was reporting a crime and wanted to leave. They made me wait like they could not care less. Or maybe it is too common and airbnb rather get paid while allowing rapes to go on. Do not rent apartments on airbnb unless you want to risk being raped because they do not care. They make you wait hours because THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT GUESTS BEING SEEN NAKED OR RAPED! THEY do their best to ignore your safety too because they do not want to refund you when you are at risk. This is a criminal company and should be shut down! Everyone working for Airbnb should be put in jail!
2025-07-08,1,Came For A Vacation.. Almost Walked Into A Nightmare,"I’ve never written a review like this, but what happened to my family and me deserves serious attention—not just as a customer complaint, but as a safety warning.

We arrived late at night to our Airbnb rental after a long day of travel, exhausted and just hoping to get our kids into bed. 

Trusting Airbnb’s built-in navigation feature—something we assumed would be accurate and reliable—we followed the provided directions. What happened next was completely unacceptable: the navigation led us to the next door neighbors home. In the dark, with unfamiliar surroundings, and in a residential neighborhood, we unknowingly approached and tried to access a private home that was not our rental. The neighbors, THANKFULLY, opened their door and graciously told the two frazzled women and their three children in tow trying to break into their home, that the AirBnB that we were looking for was next door.
 
I cannot emphasize enough how dangerous this situation could have become. Imagine being a homeowner and seeing strangers—my family and I—approaching your door at 10pm, shaking your door, pissed off that the door code isn't working. It’s a terrifying scenario for both parties. We were lucky. The residents were understandably alarmed but not confrontational. Had the homeowners been more frightened or defensive, or had this occurred in a place with heightened security concerns, the outcome could have been catastrophic. People have been shot in driveways for less. We reached out to the host, and he was responsive, but didn't seem to recognize the gravity of the situation. 

We were shaken, and deeply unsettled. This was not user error. This was a failure of Airbnb’s system—a failure with potentially grave consequences. 

I want to be clear: this isn’t just an inconvenience or a tech glitch. It’s a serious safety flaw. Airbnb cannot afford to have its internal navigation directing guests to the wrong addresses, especially not at night and especially not when tensions can escalate quickly in unfamiliar neighborhoods. If Airbnb is going to offer built-in navigation tools, they must be rigorously verified and guaranteed accurate. Otherwise, don’t offer them at all. Until this issue is addressed, I strongly urge future guests to double-check addresses manually using trusted map services—and I urge Airbnb to treat this as the liability risk and public safety hazard it clearly is.

We came for a vacation. We nearly walked into a nightmare."
2025-07-08,1,Absolutely no customer support,"Absolutely no customer support. I had a terrible experience with a host, and Airbnb’s response was to ask me to work it out directly with them—burning through the only 72-hour window they offer for support. After 72 hours of being mistreated by the host, Airbnb said they could no longer help because the time had expired. Completely unacceptable. This was my first and last time using Airbnb. Never again."
2025-07-08,2,Their website is problematic,"Their website is problematic.   For months I could not log in.   Today I was able to, but the prices they showed were in some foreign currency that I did not recognize.   I tried again, and this time the site sent me to services that I am not interested in.  Come on!  Don't you want us to be your customer?"
2025-07-08,1,Their reviews system can't be trusted,"I stayed in a dirty, unmaintained, and old apartment. I added a review so other people would be aware. After one month, I received a notification from Airbnb stating that my review had been removed because it involved ""pressure or coercion."", which is not true. They are just trying to hide the truth.

For reference, here is my review:

The flat is well-located, but we didn’t enjoy our stay for several reasons:

•⁠  ⁠Mattresses were very thin and uncomfortable.
•⁠  ⁠Heating never worked. We reported it on Friday; after a 30 min call, the technician couldn’t fix it. The host then disappeared until Monday and suddenly demanded access within 50 minutes while we were out (after ignoring the problem all weekend).
•⁠  ⁠The shower kept cutting out, alternating scalding and freezing water.
•⁠  ⁠No soap in the bathroom.
•⁠  ⁠Living-room seats were cramped and looked like cut-up, uncovered foam.
•⁠  ⁠Towels were worn and cheap.
•⁠  ⁠No drying rack for clothes.
•⁠  ⁠Flat smelled musty and lacked ventilation.
•⁠  ⁠Overall, old and cheap furniture
•⁠  ⁠Cleanliness was poor. Eg. heavy dust, dirt, and an old pair of slippers under the beds."
2025-07-07,1,Security Deposit Return,"After we departed and the host sent two complimentary messages about the condition of the apartment (""We will write you a great five star review with great comments! You are welcome to stay at our apartment anytime again!"") and then refused to return the 1000 Euro security deposit.  The Airbnb resolution center is worthless.  "
2025-07-07,1,Trashy Company Account Permanently Shut,"Extremly Horrible pls READ: Airbnb shut down my account for having my gun with me where there are a lot of bears, there was one in the back yard so I took the gun from the car inside for caution, forgot the gun there and the airbnb shut down my account, I’ll be happily using platforms that are humanity compliant and not this trash of a company, even if my account gets returned I’ll boycott Airbnb moving forward. 
My appeal got denied despite deliberate danger of having bears all over these mountains, Airbnb is distasteful.  "
2025-07-07,1,Misleading claim of “All fees included”,"The upfront claim that prices shown would include all fees was wrong. (I understand that taxes would be additional). A displayed price for 4 nights in Atlanta was NOT inclusive of fees, and when I attempted to reserve the property an Airbnb fee appeared. The result was that an estimated $1400 total with taxes became $1600 I did not book.
 A series of chats provided no relief. I felt that a waiver of the Airbnb fee was warranted but, apparently, there is no mechanism at Airbnb to allow this. I notice that since my chats, the property’s displayed pricing has been corrected.
Poor response to my inquiry. I should note that this mis-step is Airbnb’s fault, not the host’s."
2025-07-07,1,Airbnb / Host communication = complete joke. ,"I booked an apartment on March 16th for September 5th–11th in Dubrovnik. Unfortunately, due to circumstances in my family, I couldn’t go. I asked for a full refund two months before my stay, which I think is more than enough time for the host to find new guests. I paid €640 in March, but all I got back was €278 — I lost almost €400 for something the host had nothing to do with, but also did nothing to help with.

I tried to contact the host many times and explained my situation — no answer. I even tried to call him, but the phone number he gave to Airbnb wasn’t real. He says guests can email him, but there’s no email address to write to — complete joke. Even Airbnb support tried to reach him and he didn’t respond. This shows how unprofessional this host (and honestly the platform) can be. Bookingdotcom has better options and policies for fair refunds — I don’t understand how something like this is allowed here. I do not recommend booking with this host/platform. "
2025-07-07,1,Airbnb He abandoned me along with the host ,"Hello! I made a reservation on Airbnb in March for my trip to London in June. Coming from Brazil, my first country was Turkey. One day before my flight to London, the host canceled. I was abandoned .Alone like garbage! The host didn't even have the decency to let me know, I called because grandma didn't call me and I was already arriving. The host is Henry and Carol, in front of the Harrords store in London.Cozy pod is the name of the ad and today I looked and it was advertised there again. I want to be reimbursed for the amount that I had to pay much more expensive in another place and the shock I felt I will never forget. How much I I was shaking. I didn't even have the right to cry, because I needed to find a place. Everyone knows how expensive and difficult London is to find. I did it through booking because I lost confidence in Airbnb."
2025-07-07,1,No longer good for hosting…,"If you are considering letting your property via Airbnb, probably better to go with a competitor such as booking.com

Customer services lack common sense and profit margins are always placed to head of customer service 

They've also just changed their cancellation period without any consultation with hosts.

Will be moving to a competitor platform for future reservations."
2025-07-07,1,Airbnb Allowed Dangerous Guest and Refuses to Remove His Review,"As an Airbnb host, I was put in a terrifying situation. A guest named Ali booked my property for 3–5 June 2025. Just before his arrival, I discovered he had a criminal record including a murder conviction. I reported this immediately to Airbnb.

After hours of delay, Airbnb confirmed the threat and cancelled his booking, arranging alternative accommodation. However, despite their own safety decision, they are now refusing to remove his review — a review from someone they deemed too dangerous to stay in my home.

I feel unsupported, unsafe, and punished for doing the right thing. I urge Airbnb to fix this, remove the review, and take accountability for endangering hosts like me."
2025-07-07,1,Joke of a company,"I am a superhost and Airbnb just teases you with rewards that never happen.

Been sent the same coupon for 2 different evaluation periods. Absolute joke of a company.
nobody has answers. JOKE"
2025-07-07,1,The picture on ABNB website does not…,"The picture on ABNB website does not match what we walked into. The sofa was cracked and dirty. The house was filthy, mole on the shower curtain, in two bathrooms. The beds in two bedrooms had wood underneath the mattress making sleeping very uncomfortable. The outside kitchen which appeared beautiful in the pictures was not functioning. There was trash thrown on the side of the house. The host Valerie was very rude. She ask us to vacate to property. We were all seniors with no place to move. Then the ABNB support agreed with the Host after we submitted pictures to them. I’m done with AirBnb never again. Then the host responded with fake reviews to say the property was wonderful. Ha Ha Hope people look further if there is one bad review believe it. "
2025-07-07,1,Really poor customer service,"Really poor customer service. They cannot provide a simple receipt for a stay (I have been given 4 for my latest stay, based on three payments and a VAT receipt for the fees only). They are an absolute joke. "
2025-07-07,1,Trustpilot отзыв:AIRBNB ignored evidence and braked my reputation ,"Trustpilot отзыв:

I have been a loyal Airbnb Superhost for many years with over 130 five-star reviews and a proven record of guest satisfaction.

Recently, I faced a deeply unfair situation that completely shattered my trust in Airbnb’s system. A guest entered my apartment on the wrong date due to her own mistake, which is fully documented in Airbnb’s messaging system. Despite her clear responsibility, she blamed me in her public review.

What is worse, the guest contacted me via private WhatsApp messages and sent her PayPal payment request while simultaneously making additional complaints. This was a clear case of financial pressure and coercion outside the Airbnb platform. I provided all the evidence, including screenshots, proving this guest’s unethical behavior.

However, Airbnb rejected my appeal automatically, within seconds, without allowing me to defend myself properly or speak to anyone from the decision-making team. It was obvious that no real human reviewed my case.

I tried multiple times to escalate the situation, to talk to Senior Management, but I was blocked at every step. I was told that “the decision cannot be reversed” even though I had undeniable proof.

After years of working hard to maintain my Superhost status and offer the best possible guest experience, Airbnb simply destroyed my reputation by ignoring the facts.

Airbnb no longer protects its Superhosts. The platform now prioritizes unjust guest reviews, even when they are provably false and financially coercive.

This is a shocking and devastating experience that I never expected from Airbnb.
"
2025-07-07,2,Refund Pending,"I’m extremely frustrated with Airbnb. My friends and I booked a stay in Polperro for July 19–20 with a host named LUCA. The payment was processed, but then the host declined our request because she doesn’t accept ONE-NIGHT reservations—something that should’ve been clearly stated in the listing upfront. Now our money is on hold, and we’re unable to book another place. Most listings are filling up quickly, and we’re stuck. The whole process feels really unfair—if a host needs to approve a stay, that should happen before any payment is taken. Airbnb’s only response has been to tell us to WAIT, which is incredibly frustrating."
2025-07-07,1,Newly refurbished - no chance! ,"Newly refurbished? Yes 10 years ago maybe! We are appalled at how we were treated both through air BnB and the hosts. The property didn’t not match the pictures on the booking. We raised the issues on day 1 of the trip and the host tried to send somone out to sort it, however they could not sort the problems. Stained headboard, broken bed which a panel fell on my mums leg. We went away as a family for my brothers wedding with babies and our dog which the listing clearly stated pets were allowed (at no extra charge or authorisation needed). Air BnB have been no help as they stated we should have made air BnB aware on day one so they could move us. We could not be moved or have the time do this as mentioned we had babies and were there for my brothers wedding so we couldn’t just leave the wedding to be moved houses - it’s completely impractical. I have picture evidence of everything including WhatsApp messages proving we notified the host of all the issues immediately. The house was not maintained and was quite frankly filthy to the point we had to clean it and sleep on top of sleeping bags on the bed. I have left a bad review on the hosts which has now resulted in them leaving a bed review about us - which is laughable. The whole process is floored and we were only refunded £125 cleaning fee, out of the £1,200 we wait. It’s honestly a joke. I use Airbnb all the time and the one time we have had a problem it’s not gone against us. It’s caused nothing but stress and upset and ruined what was supposed to be a lovely weekend celebrating a wedding. I would love to upload the pictures for other guests to be aware of but surprisingly you can’t!!!! 
Avoid Anna & John hosts who supposedly are from London - now living in wales. Also a lie they told us they now live in Australia. Just money for them no care in their actual properties. 
The house was stayed at sleeps up to 13 people in Treforest Wales. 
As a proclaimed family not sure how they sleep at night tbh! "
2025-07-07,1,I ended up in some sort of brothel,I ended up in some sort of brothel. Airbnb support was not supportive at all. They showed no empathy and talked about fixing the plumbing issue instead. Zero stars!
2025-07-07,1,Horrible Cancellation Policy,"I booked a place and eight days later, two weeks before I was booked to stay, I had to cancel for an illness in the family. Airbnb did nothing to assist. They leave it up to the host and support the hosts decision as to whether or not you will get a refund. The worst part is the host can book someone else for the same days that I already paid for. So even if someone else books the same days, the host and Airbnb keep the money from both transactions. I am closing my account."
2025-07-07,1,The worst company by far!,"The worst company by far! It feels like it's run by clueless teenagers who are just reading off a script. I sent evidence that the room I booked in a shared flat was entered into without my knowledge and consent by three different people on top of a range of other issues, which was acknowledged by the call handler who told me it's wrong. Then they spent 3 days ''investigating'' asking me to repeat everything all over again to 3 different people, mad a decision taking the host's side and couldn't even bother to explain why. I'm just given their decision and the case is closed. They communicate through links. The link to their T&C states unauthorised entry into the rented premises is prohibited. Yet, they rule out in favour of the host with no explanation whatsoever. I won't even begin to describe the other issues which made me leave the place earlier losing money which they won't recover from the host. Their protection is non-existent. There's no cover, no insurance. You're on your own. It's all just a smoke screen. This is not the first issue I've had with Air Bnb over the years. But it is definitely the last as I'll never use Air Bnb again. Horrific!"
2025-07-07,1,Airbnb give more support to the guests than to the hosts ,"Im Airbnb host and I can literally say that Airbnb only care about guests. When the subject is being a host they don’t care much as they care to guess. 
I will give you an example. I had a guest that left my front door unlocked from 1:30am till I got home at 3:00pm. I wrote on guest profile review, I called Airbnb and they told me that my review is under review. 
I can’t believe that this company besides of give more assistance to guests, they need to approve a safety matter review. Unbelievable, disrespectful and unprofessional. "
2025-07-06,1,Awful ‘service’ from Airbnb,"Terrible ‘service’ from Airbnb.  We stayed in a guest house that had no hot water - amongst other things and they would only refund me 10%.  They were going to give me another £10, but because I escalated the matter - (as I wanted a refund), they said they would not honour the £10 and I could only get 10% off the price."
2025-07-06,1,Booked two places to stay ,"Booked two places to stay , paid through Paypal, got emails saying the hosts could not accommodate my stay , then have to wait a week for a refund . "
2025-07-06,1,Air BNB is Terrible!!!!!,"I have been using air bnb for years….over 27 stays and have never had a problem until now. I rented a place and had nothing but problems from the start. I wish we could put in pictures to show the justice. I walked into the home and immediately the first thing I saw was overgrown grass up to my 6 foot tall husband’s waist into the stomach with abandoned shopping carts everywhere. They said we would have use of a patio that was a lie. The entire property wreaked like animal urine, and you could see spots on the carpet and on the couch, where there was obvious animal urine. Outside of that there was food left in the sink. There was food left in the microwave. The entire floor was gross. I believe this just touches the surface of everything that I encountered and that my children were forced to sleep in the animal Urine smell because I was told by the host to just use for breeze we didn’t get in until 11:30 PM so we had no choice but to sleep there. Another thing we were not told is you could hear every movement going through the house so nobody got any sleep. I contacted Airbnb immediately at 5 AM the next morning. I went on for days with Airbnb, trying to get a refund I was told at one point I would receive a refund I didn’t. I was told to leave the property immediately that morning, and I would get a refund which I left the property and still again no refund at the very beginning of our trip I had to come out another $700 just to find last-minute housing for me and my family finally after days of arguing with Airbnb they only refunded me half of what I paid for the week of the Airbnb, which they didn’t even want to do that. The only reason they did was because what they claimed was an employee that was not qualified to told me that I would get a refund. I went to the highest person at Airbnb. I am very, very disgusted and overall dissatisfied and will not be using Airbnb again. I will be using VRBO and Expedia rentals. My renter was nothing that was described in the pictures. The smell was unbearable and a health hazard to my children and Airbnb refused to do nothing about it but give me half of a refund only because somebody messed up and told me they would otherwise I was told by air B and B I would not have gotten a refund. Very disappointed and unsatisfied to say the least beware of any Airbnb‘s that you get because Airbnb will not cover you."
2025-07-06,1,RIP off,"Literally they are taking the mickey
They started with a reasonable commission and now they’re your 50% business partner. 
It’s your house, you wash the bedding, you clean the house, you do the communication, you host the guests and Airbnb takes the half if your earning. 
Look somewhere else I’d say. Plenty options "
2025-07-06,1, Poor Customer Support and Overpriced,"I’ve used Airbnb multiple times over the years, but my recent experience has completely put me off. When things go wrong, Airbnb does not have your back. I had an issue with a listing that was completely misrepresented – dirty, unsafe, and nothing like the photos – and Airbnb’s support team was slow, unhelpful, and clearly more interested in protecting the host than solving the problem.

Trying to get a refund or even proper communication was like pulling teeth. They talk a big game about “trust and safety,” but when you’re actually in a bad situation, you’re left to fend for yourself.

What’s worse, Airbnb has become ridiculously overpriced. Cleaning fees, service fees, and vague cancellation policies make the final cost far higher than expected. I’ve since tried other platforms that are not only cheaper but actually care about their customers when issues arise.

I won’t be using Airbnb again – there are better, more transparent alternatives out there."
2025-07-05,1,Terrible customer service,"I've been a loyal Airbnb user for nearly a decade, but recent experiences have left me deeply disappointed.

First, I accidentally made a booking and attempted to cancel it within seconds. Despite the immediate action, I lost nearly £3,000 due to Airbnb’s rigid cancellation process. The user interface is confusing and lacks clear warnings for high-value transactions—something that should be a basic standard for any platform handling large sums. Airbnb offered no meaningful support or resolution.

Second, I paid for a trip in pounds but was refunded in Airbnb booking credits—without any clear explanation or consent. I wasn’t even aware of what booking credits were at the time. Once again, Airbnb refused to assist or offer a fair resolution.

These experiences reflect the worst customer service I’ve encountered in over 10 years of using online platforms. Airbnb’s lack of transparency, inflexible policies, and unhelpful support have eroded my trust in a brand I once valued."
2025-07-05,1,"Needs more consistent search results, profile badges, and user permissions","Airbnb needs to:
- Have more consistent search experiences (Doesn't show my listing when the ""Instant Book"" filter is on, even though I have ""Instant Book"" enabled

- Have consistent listing badges (It shows ""4 min walk to Lake"" for my competitors in the exact same building but shows ""6 min walk to Lake"" for me? This isn't fair

- Allow hosts to opt out of Early Access Features/ Beta Program (You can opt in but cant opt out?)"
2025-07-05,1,Air BnB reviews are all fake,"Air BnB reviews are all fake. We have a 1 star but air BnB changed it completely SCAM

Don't trust them stayed in a house in Suffolk windows were shout sealed couldn't open any weather conditions extremely hot very dangerous for someone who has asthma or breathing issues as well as fire case of the house did catch a fire.

Friends car was keyed also so guessing the area is a unsafe. Wrot e a review argued my case with air BnB and guess what they changed my review completely to what I said.DO NOT TRUST AIR BNB REVIEWS GUYS ITS ALL A SCAM "
2025-07-05,1,"Unsafe Stay, Misleading Listing – Airbnb Removed My Review","My friend booked the ""Seaside Luxury House on the Suffolk Coast"", hosted by Tim and Lucy, through Airbnb — and it turned into a nightmare.

My friend’s car was vandalised overnight while parked on the street outside the property. This made us feel unsafe in the area.

Worse, all the windows in the house were screwed shut. We stayed during 30°C heat, and without any way to ventilate the house, it became extremely hot and humid. This made the stay deeply uncomfortable and unsuitable for sleeping or relaxing.

I left a 1-star review on Airbnb describing the experience truthfully. Airbnb removed my review and the listing still shows 5 stars, which is completely misleading and dishonest. It feels like Airbnb protects hosts, even when guest safety and comfort are clearly at risk.

Airbnb should be ashamed of how this was handled. Guests deserve honesty and safety — not censorship."
2025-07-05,1,Shady Airbnb  After being a super host for 8 years o…,After being a super host for 8 years o no longer will be a part of such a shady company 
2025-07-04,1,One of the Worst Airbnb Experiences Ever – Safety Nightmare and Total Scam,"The property we stayed at is an absolute disgrace and a ticking time bomb of safety hazards. Most alarming was the padlock on the back deck gate, which meant there was only one exit through the front door. In an emergency like a fire, we could have been trapped and killed inside. When I raised this very real and obvious safety issue with the host, my concern was flat-out ignored. This is likely a blatant violation of the fire code and the short-term rental ordinance of Pagosa Springs.

To make matters worse, there were multiple surveillance cameras installed around the property—some shockingly aimed directly into private living spaces like bedrooms and the living room. This is a massive invasion of privacy and absolutely unacceptable.

One upstairs bedroom had a rough, unfinished wood floor with exposed nails—combined with the house’s “shoes off” policy, this was a recipe for injuries. One of our guests found out the hard way with cuts and splinters.

The kitchen was another horror show. The “non-stick” cookware had lost all its coating, meaning anyone cooking with it was being poisoned with PFAS chemicals—known carcinogens linked to cancer. The grill was filthy and caked with grease, completely unusable and a major fire hazard. Thank goodness we checked it before trying to light it.

There was also a cracked ceramic tile in the kitchen with razor-sharp edges, creating yet another spot where you had to wear shoes indoors for basic safety.

The so-called “game room” was a pathetic joke—after cramming in the ping pong and shuffleboard tables, there were only inches left for a person to squeeze in, rendering these amenities completely useless.

In the primary bedroom, there were no bedside lamps, forcing us to stumble around in the dark to find wall switches every night.

When we arrived, the home was stifling and smelled off, with an indoor temperature of 90 degrees. It took hours to cool it down to 75, and with no cooling upstairs, those rooms were basically uninhabitable during the day and well into the night.

The host, VIP Vacation Services in Pagosa Springs, was the worst part. They ignored safety concerns, insisted on communicating outside of Airbnb, and demanded additional payments outside the platform—both clear violations of Airbnb’s policies.

Airbnb support has been a complete joke in trying to resolve these issues, offering no meaningful solution so far. This property should not be listed on Airbnb or anywhere else until these major safety, health, and habitability issues are fixed. Rent at your own risk—you’ve been warned."
2025-07-04,1,Unsafe conditions,"Unsafe conditions, mold, and poor support — AirCover failed me

I stayed at an Airbnb where water was leaking from the ceiling onto the bed and visible black mold was growing in the HVAC vent above me. I reported the issue immediately after arrival, but had no safe option to leave right away — it was late at night, the neighborhood was unsafe, and I had no alternative accommodation.

Despite reporting this under AirCover, I received only a partial refund, even though the place was clearly unfit for living. I had to sleep one night under these conditions only because I had no other choice. I was deeply concerned for my health, and my dog developed breathing problems after this stay.

Support was slow, and in the end, they said a full refund was “not possible,” even though I followed all the steps required by Airbnb’s policies. This was a clear failure of the AirCover guarantee, and it left me feeling dismissed and unsupported.

If Airbnb really values guest safety, they should have handled this very differently. I do not feel protected, and I now question whether I can trust the platform at all.

2025-07-04,1,Left without accommodation before flight — no support,"My Airbnb reservation was canceled by the host after the stay had already started. I was traveling with children and expected Airbnb to handle the situation responsibly.

Unfortunately, Airbnb failed to provide a confirmed replacement or follow their own guest protection policy. I received only a $300 coupon and no guaranteed alternative. I still have no place to stay, and my flight is tomorrow.

This was my first Airbnb booking, and it turned into a deeply stressful and disappointing experience. I hope Airbnb improves how it handles urgent cancellations like this one."

The house was dirty and not near the village as described. When I went back to Air B and B looking for compensation although the people I spoke to were polite the whole system is ridiculous, I don't know how many times I had to ring and I resend the pictures. I would urge anyone to read the small print re refunds before you book with them, and really I would suggest not using them at all. Although I received a minimum refund from the host it did not reflect the awful stay we had. I was told I should have left the place and try and find new accommodation when I was in Doolin to attend my nieces wedding and there was no other accommodation available. Clearly as a business they don't really care about peoples reviews and experiences. I do feel sorry for the genuine super hosts that put so much effort into making their accommodation good when there are other like we had that Air B and B claim is 5 star when I wouldn't rate is as even one star. I would love to be able to show the pictures I took so everyone could see what I mean but they don't even give you that chance. All in all I will never use them again to book accommodation.        "
2025-07-04,1,Falsely Accused by Airbnb Host – 3 Years Without Justice or Support,"I’m writing this after nearly three years of trying to resolve a completely false and damaging accusation made by an Airbnb host, and once again, Airbnb’s customer support has shut down the conversation without providing any real help.

During a group trip, the host accused me and my guests of watching adult content on their television — a completely false and unfounded claim. Even more disturbing is how the host manipulated the platform by writing “P orn” (with a space) in the review to bypass Airbnb’s moderation system. Despite this clear manipulation and the fact that the accusation is baseless, the review remains on the platform.

To make matters worse, I was removed from the trip after the stay, which prevented me from leaving my own review or responding publicly to defend myself. I lost my right to reply, while the host was allowed to publicly attack my character.

I contacted Airbnb support multiple times over the past three years. Each time, I carefully explained the situation and submitted evidence. The response has always been the same: “We consider the case closed.” No real review, no fair process, no support for the guest — just a dead-end.

The host’s accusation is not just petty — it is harmful, embarrassing, and untrue. It has affected my reputation on the platform and caused me enormous frustration. It’s shocking that Airbnb allows hosts to make defamatory claims without proof, and then silences the guest who is trying to respond.

I’ve always used Airbnb with respect and followed the rules. I never expected to be treated this way — not just by a dishonest host, but by a platform that claims to “build trust” and “support the community.”

After years of being ignored, I’m sharing my story here in hopes that someone will listen. Airbnb must be held accountable when it fails to protect its users from false accusations and one-sided reviews. A platform that promotes “community” should ensure fairness — not silence the victims.

2025-07-04,1,"Betsy the retro caravan in Dundee, bad hosts on airbnb","Booked ""Betsy the retro caravan in the woods"" in Angus, Scotland with the host Sally Marie in March this year for the 5th of July. The host knew it was for 2 festival goers and that the festival closes at 11pm. They asked tonight, the day before the booking what time we'd arrive only to state they didn't want my custom as there would be 2 cars as one guest is from Aberdeen and she was going to meet us there & I am from Glasgow. They stated they didn't want us coming back in the early hours as we'd ""rouse"" the guard dogs and other guests. There was only 2 people staying there as per the rules which wouldn't have been broken by us. They knew we'd be getting back late anyway as we are attending a festival. I've had to cancel the booking the night before we were due to stay because this host didn't state there was a curfew.
No where on their listing do they state the type of guests they wanted nor did they say parking was limited.

Is discrimination over the type of guests we are and their hosts communication is terrible. I did try and speak with them in march only to be told speak nearer the time.

So now I'm left with one day to find alternative accommodation for 2 people.

They have stated we are not the sort of guests they want as we'd annoy other guests and the animals because we'd be getting back in the early morning, probably around 6am due to attending an club night then visiting a friend, it's discrimination not wanting two 40 year old women because we will attend a festival then a night club.

If they wanted tea drinking oaps and the sort of customers that prefer watching antiques roadshow over visiting clubs they should state it on their listing.

2025-07-03,1,AIRBNB DOESNT HELP WITH BAD HOSTS,"I have spent OVER 3 hours trying to report a host after a horrible experience. I wanted to check in and the host said I have to wait an extra hour after regular check in time because they need to still clean it. Got a room reserved for 2 nights (May 13-15, 2025) and when I walked in, I immediately left and asked for a refund. Felt extremely unsafe, wasnt cleaned in what looked like a year, and the host was rude and unprofessional telling me to clean the room and bathroom myself if I want to check in at 5pm (the regular check in time). Host fined me $800 USD for damages (I didnt do) and left an extremely negative and completely false review. After speaking with 6 people because Airbnb made this a 2 month thing.....they still didn't do anything. Because of my truthful review, the host fined a report of discrimination, THIS IS A JOKE!!!! Its insane because there was none and i was polite the entire time to her. When I reached out to Airbnb to see the status of this on July 2, yes no help since May 13......instead of approving my request of deleting the hosts false review of me, Airbnb deleted MY TRUTHFUL review. And when checking on the hosts account, the other negative review that was there (similar to mine) was ALSO DELETED so this host now has 5 stars because out honest reviews were taken off......Airbnb is NOT on your team. This is a very short review because the full story is VERY lengthy. The fact that the worst experience & host on Airbnb HIDES honest reviews, this doesn't make me safe trusting other hosts because it could be the same situation as this one. Airbnb and this host has emotionally distressed me and at this point, with their ""resolution"" have lost me as a client forever and have gained a free bad review anytime I can share the cult Airbnb is. I want to leave a review about Airbnb on Airbnb but it doesn't seem to be an option. At this point I will use other apps or just get the damn hotel. Protect yourselves. 


EDIT: they said they will not remove the host's false, defamatory and triggering (because of the hosts abuse to me) review. This is my final thoughts on airbnb:

 Airbnb doesn't care about their guests. Airbnb is putting innocent people in danger by removing the negative (yet truthful) reviews of this host. I do not feel safe with any hosts since Airbnb is trying to keep their ""good"" fake image up. 

Airbnb support is a joke and I feel betrayed. "

2025-07-03,1,Dishonest and Useless Airbnb Support – Beware,"Extremely disappointed with Airbnb support. We booked a property described as private, but it turned out to be a shared flat — something never clearly mentioned in the listing. It was noisy and impossible to rest.

We contacted Airbnb support immediately after check-in, but they did nothing to help. Instead, they kept telling us they were “waiting for the host to respond.” This was a lie — when we spoke to the property manager (acting as the host), he told us Airbnb had never contacted him at all.

Out of a 5-day trip, we wasted more than 28 hours waiting for Airbnb to solve the issue. In the end, it was the property manager who listened to us and negotiated directly with the property owner so we could leave early and get a refund.

Airbnb support was useless and misleading. For a company of this size, this level of inaction and dishonesty is unacceptable.

Whilst I understand there can be bad hostess who lie and give misleading reviews .  It is up to Airbnb to rectify and act as a third party to protect both parties. Instead their policies enable continued success for repeat situational mishaps and repeat bad dishonest behaviours from hosts.

Throughout the day I kept receiving notifications I would lose my reservation if I did not verify but when I clicked on the link it said I was already verified. Finally I called.

At this point I had put in my license photos, confirmed my name, put in the last four of my social, and confirmed my mailing address. The rep told me it was an Airbnb issue and would escalate it. This was after almost an hour on the phone and so I asked if it would be done by 55 mins later when my message said my reservation would cancel. She said mmmhmm to which I asked please for a yes or no - got an mmhmm again so I asked two more times and finally she said “for full transparency no they may take 24 hours.”

I asked to be handed to a supervisor and when I finally got one they gaslit me, told me I hadn’t verified even as I told them they could reference the recording from the previous rep and that I could email them screenshots. They wasted my time for another hour before figuring out I WAS verified and it was their fault - during which time I lost the reservation and it was booked when I reached out to try to reserve again once they cleared the issue.

I will not go back and would rather pay more for a hotel or try VRBO then ever interact with them again."

Despite contacting them multiple times, I have received no proper explanation — only delays, generic replies, and excuses. Their customer service has been completely unhelpful and has wasted my time while holding on to my money. It feels like my money has been stolen while they hide behind vague policies.

I strongly advise anyone considering Airbnb to be careful and think twice. If something goes wrong, you risk losing both your booking and your money — and you might be falsely blamed for something you have nothing to do with.

I am a host on Airbnb and recently faced a serious issue with my payout. Airbnb sent me less money than the amount shown in my host dashboard, and when I asked for an explanation, they claimed the difference was due to a bank deduction.

I contacted my bank, and they confirmed that no deduction was made on their end. I asked Airbnb multiple times for proof of the full amount sent (such as a remittance slip or transaction ID), but they refused to provide any documentation. Their support kept giving generic replies and closed the case without resolution.

This lack of transparency is unacceptable, especially when it involves money owed to hosts. As a long-time host, I am extremely disappointed with Airbnb’s handling of this matter.

I hope Airbnb will take this seriously and resolve the issue, or I will be forced to take legal action and stop using the platform."

He asked me to use my money and that he would refund when the time came, he refused.

I was thrown out of the house around 12:43 am. even though my booking was supposed to expire in 4 days. I was able to capture vidoes, pictures and voice recordings, despite all of that, airbnb fully aware they're allowing a criminal host on their site refused to take down the listing and continues to accept bookings from him.

I was hoping they would do the right thing before I take this to every news outlet and involve the government and make sure they suffer losses in millions of dollars. I opened a case with them with bbb, and they somehow changed it to a refund or exchange case. I am not asking for a refund, I'm asking for this case to be investigated, and the host is rightfully removed before he does this to someone else. I'm giving it this week. If nothing is done, there's no point of return on my legal actions.

Mind you, I sent them pictures, videos, voice recordings and they still allowed the criminal of a host to continue renting out apartments.

I'll make sure I put an end to this. I was advised to reach out to them again and gather more proof before we make sob.

Me and the host have both reached out to customer service and are still being hassled. I have only received a partial credit of $79 for our $1100 stay that we did not get to even stay one day at. I am very disappointed with Airbnb. I will NEVER use this booking company again in the future. Customer service is horrible, I have had to argue with multiple representatives and when I ask to speak to a manager they say “she will say the same thing” then never connect me.

This was our first – and definitely last – time using Airbnb. We stayed at an apartment in Riga, Latvia. We were very respectful and careful, and even filmed a broken light switch on arrival to avoid being blamed.

After our stay, the host made a false €15 claim and then posted a defamatory review full of lies, clearly in retaliation for our honest feedback.

Airbnb cancelled the money request but refused to remove the false review, despite proof. This shows that Airbnb protects dishonest hosts, allowing them to publicly attack guests.

We’re going back to Booking.com, where we’ve never been treated this way.

Absolutely unacceptable experience"
2025-07-01,1,Flawed ID verification process,"I was a first time UK user, wanting to book a cottage in the Peak District for a few days. The booking was part confirmed, and I'd made an initial deposit payment when i was told I had to have my identity verified. 

For some reason, AirBNB's system could not do this simply by matching my debit card details with my address (despite me living at the same address for over ten years). Instead they wanted a form of photo ID. They specified either a driving licence; passport or national identity card. 

Well, I still have the old fashioned paper driving licence and the UK does not have a national identity card. My passport has my photo on it but is expired. however, I proceeded to submitted it anyway, confident that would be acceptable. After all:
a) it was acceptable to the Electoral Commission (allowing me to vote UK elections); and 
b) it was acceptable to my last employer (when they offered me s job).

No, it was rejected by AirBNB due tit o being expired.

When I rang up to query what alternative there were, i was told, there wasn't any. I pointed out, both on the phone and in an email to customer services, that:
a) it is not compulsory to learn to drive;
b) it is not compulsory to travel abroad; and
c) the UK doesn't have a NIC!

The response of AirBNB was simply to reiterate the three options, claiming that its users found reassurance in the ID verification system being in place and as a company, it was seen as a way to combat fraud. I pointed out that if they were so concerned with preventing fraud, then why hadn't they asked me to verify my ID BEFORE TAKING A PAYMENT FROM ME.

AirBNB are clearly only interest it taking your money, (not fraud etc). This point was underlined when they emailed me, suggesting that someone else from my group, take up the booking instead. 

WHAT A BLOODY CHEEK!

I raised several issues with the company, including the fact that UK users only have a choice of two forms of ID (not three), but they have repeatedly ignored my queries. indeed, they haven't even acknowledge the points, let alone offer a solution.

THIS WAS FIRST EXPERENCE OF TRYING TO USE 'AIRBNB' AND IT WILL BE MY LAST."

2025-06-30,1,Airbnb support confirmed early checkout due to unlivable conditions – then refused refund,"I booked a 5-night stay in Germany through Airbnb. When I arrived, the apartment was in unacceptable condition: cobwebs, visible dirt, dead insects, a musty smell, and loud constant noise from neighboring guests. I documented everything with photos and videos and contacted Airbnb support within 2 hours of check-in.

Airbnb support offered me two options:

    Stay and get a 30% refund for the remaining nights

    Leave early and receive a refund for the unused nights

I chose the second option. Airbnb confirmed that I was allowed to check out early, and I left the apartment the next morning before 10:00 a.m. I submitted all relevant documentation and proof.

Days later, Airbnb informed me that I would only receive €8.10 — just 10% of a single night — because I ""refused a cleaning offer."" This is misleading. I did not refuse cleaning in principle — I simply declined to let strangers into an apartment I was already occupying. The apartment was not fit for check-in in the first place.

Airbnb closed the case, ignored their own communication, and refused further review. The host was also disrespectful, mocking my language and sending voice messages via WhatsApp. Airbnb failed to apply its own guest protection policies (AirCover) and left me with a meaningless refund.

This case was handled unprofessionally and irresponsibly. I have now filed a complaint with the German Verbraucherzentrale (consumer protection agency).


Update (July 1):
After ongoing communication, documentation, and escalation, Airbnb eventually resolved the case fairly. I received a refund for all unused nights and a partial compensation for the first night and cleaning fee. Special thanks to Mostafa S. from Airbnb support, who personally took over and handled the matter with professionalism and genuine care.

While I’m grateful for the resolution, it only happened after significant effort and frustration. The standard support flow was disappointing and ineffective.

Rating updated to 3 stars to reflect the final outcome and the individual support I received – not the system as a whole.


UPDATE: Host posted defamatory review, Airbnb refuses to remove it

After Airbnb acknowledged my complaint and issued a refund, the host posted a public response falsely accusing me of lying and fabricating evidence. This directly contradicts Airbnb’s own decision in my favor.

I followed all Airbnb support instructions to report the review. They told me it would be reviewed by a human, but the system rejected both of my removal attempts automatically — support knew this, yet insisted I try again. When I pointed out the manipulation, they claimed it was “out of their control” and closed the case.

The defamatory review remains online. Airbnb allows this to happen, even after admitting the guest was right. Completely unacceptable.

Due to this ongoing abuse and dishonesty, I have now permanently changed my rating to 1 star."

I’m honestly shocked by how Airbnb handles reviews. I was just a guest invited on a trip with my sister and mom, yet a rude and aggressive review from a horrible host now shows up on my profile. I wasn’t even allowed to leave a review in return because I wasn’t the main guest.

The irony? Airbnb refunded part of the booking because the host violated their own policies – but still allows her nasty review to stay public. Meanwhile, when I left honest feedback for another filthy apartment, my review was quietly deleted. No explanation. No support. My case was just closed without a word.

Airbnb has become a platform that protects manipulative hosts and punishes guests who speak up. The review system is broken and dangerous. This isn’t just unfair – it’s downright harmful. I’m done with this company.

I did contact the support because I don't agree with some reviews and they told me to make an inquiry so they can review and delete it. I did some and they rejected it. It was like a bot reviewed my cased. And not only that, you cannot cancel a booking as a host without paying a fee and its 56 euros. That's outrageous. On 2017 wasn't like that and the support doesn't find any solution at all. Whenever I reached them, they didn't find my any solution at all. The support system is nonexistent and not helpful at all. The platfom became very famous and doesn't care about us, the hosts, at all. 
I reccomend new hosts to go to other platforms and not on Airbnb.

A guest booked my non-refundable listing, then later claimed his daughter made the booking — after staying in contact, asking to rebook, and confirming details for 7 days. When I declined a refund, he went to his bank and claimed “unauthorized use.” Despite the full message trail proving it was not fraud, Airbnb canceled the reservation and refused to pay me — in clear violation of their own Terms.
I received 6+ identical copy-paste responses, no evidence of chargeback, no defense of my side, and no accountability from Airbnb. This is not just bad customer service — it’s systemic failure to protect hosts, and it opens a huge loophole for scammers.
If Airbnb cannot uphold basic contractual obligations for verified bookings, how can any host trust them with their property or income?
I’m calling on @Airbnb to review this case properly, and I will continue to escalate until this is resolved. Hosts: beware of this new loophole — your strict policies mean nothing if Airbnb doesn’t enforce them.

2025-06-27,1,I’ve b Airbnb sided with host despite no proof – even after a guest was injuredeen a loyal Airbnb user for over…,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user for over 3 years and never imagined I’d be writing this. But our recent experience has made it clear: Airbnb no longer protects guests from false claims, unsafe listings, or abusive charges.
After a recent stay, our host submitted a $495 damage claim filled with unsupported accusations — including trash that wasn’t ours, generic “deep cleaning” charges (despite a $150 cleaning fee already paid), and damage that clearly existed before our arrival.
One of the central accusations was that we broke a hammock — but we submitted photo proof showing that the ropes were already torn at the moment we arrived, and the first time someone sat in it, it collapsed.
That person was injured. Now ask yourself: what if it had been a child? In one of the host’s own photos, a child is seen sitting in that partially broken hammock. If it had failed under a child — would Airbnb still charge us for “causing damage”? Or would they then finally hold the host accountable for unsafe property?
We also provided proof that the host themselves asked us to bring in boxes already outside the property — boxes they later claimed were “ours.” Airbnb completely ignored this.
Airbnb claims that hosts must provide evidence of damage caused by guests during the reservation. In this case, the host provided no valid timestamps or direct links to our stay, and still — Airbnb charged us.
We were told we must pay or our card will be charged. So now, any host can submit unverified accusations, and the guest has to pay. That is a terrifying precedent and a dangerous shift in platform policy.
Airbnb, I urge you to reconsider how you evaluate evidence. If this is the level of protection you offer to responsible, long-time guests, we will have to stop using the platform entirely — and warn others to do the same.

2025-06-27,1,Family with Baby Left to Sleep in Car…,"Family with Baby Left to Sleep in Car After Airbnb Booking Failures

A young family returning from holiday was left stranded overnight in their car after a series of Airbnb booking failures left them without accommodation — despite having spent over £1,200 on the platform in a single day.

The ordeal began when the family, including their one-year-old daughter, landed back in the UK from Thailand at 7am. Hoping for a smooth transition into their week in London, they promptly booked an Airbnb property nearby for £500. With check-in not allowed until 4pm, the family waited patiently, exhausted after a long-haul journey.

But upon arrival at the property, they were shocked by what they encountered. The building’s hallways were cluttered with dirty laundry, broken furniture, and discarded mattresses. Inside the apartment, a foul smell lingered, and stains covered the curtains, sofa, and floors. The accommodation, they said, was clearly unfit for a child.

They cancelled immediately, and while Airbnb assured them the £500 would be refunded, the platform advised it could take up to 15 days to process.

Still in urgent need of somewhere to stay, the family booked a second Airbnb for £770. However, this booking was instantly cancelled. When the mother contacted Airbnb customer service, she was told the host had cancelled — although the host later confirmed they had never even received the booking details.

Now left with two large payments pending and no access to funds, the family pleaded with Airbnb for immediate assistance.

“I explained to them that I had no money left to book somewhere else. We were stranded,” said the mother. “They offered me a 20% discount voucher, which was pointless — I had no money left to use it.”

After hours on the phone, a customer service agent finally told the mother that Airbnb would provide £500 towards a new booking. She quickly found a suitable property and sent over the details. But three hours later, she received a message stating that Airbnb would not be honouring the promise.

By now, it was late in the evening. With no accommodation secured and nowhere else to turn, the family — including their baby — were forced to sleep in their car overnight.

“I told them we needed somewhere safe and warm, and that my daughter needed hot water for her bottles. Their final response was simply: ‘We cannot help.’”

The mother, who also suffers from fibromyalgia, described the experience as physically and emotionally draining. “It was humiliating and dangerous. We had just returned from a beautiful family holiday, and Airbnb put us in a vulnerable position with a baby — not because of anything we did wrong, but because of their own system errors.”

She says she has been a loyal Airbnb user for years, often booking high-value properties for family trips, and never imagined such treatment was possible. “They completely failed us when we needed them the most.”

Midnight Call Sparks Further Outrage

Adding insult to injury, Airbnb only reached out meaningfully after the mother told them she would be sharing her story with the media.

“At around 12am, after everything we’d been through, I received a call from Airbnb — conveniently only after I told them I’d be taking this to the newspapers,” she said. “Where was this urgency when my baby needed somewhere safe to sleep? Why didn’t they act hours earlier when it could’ve actually made a difference?”

The family is now demanding accountability from the company, calling on Airbnb to improve its emergency support services — especially for families travelling with young children or people with medical conditions."

The company lied to me when I booked my apartment by telling me that I could pay my rent on the first of every month, then they tried to take the next month's rent out two weeks early.
They started harassing me after I told them I was cancelling my rental because of their lying to me. After that they kept trying to take thousands of dollars out of my account, nine times in ten minutes one day.

Unfortunately, I was not refunded any amount, even partially.

I contacted Airbnb support multiple times, but they were completely unhelpful and dismissive. Despite clearly stating that I am deaf, they repeatedly told me to “call us”, which shows a complete lack of understanding and accessibility.

This experience was incredibly disappointing and frustrating. I expected better support and empathy from a global platform like Airbnb."
2025-06-27,1,I recently had one of the worst…,"I recently had one of the worst experiences with Airbnb, not just because of the property, but because of how Airbnb support handled it.

I checked into an apartment that was filthy, had dead bugs, mold, stained bedding, and a sewer smell. I reported everything within hours of arrival with photos, videos, and a full report. The conditions were clearly unsafe and violated Airbnb’s own AirCover policy.

And yet — Airbnb support kept stalling. They repeatedly told me the refund was up to the host, even though AirCover is supposed to protect guests regardless of the host’s decision. I had to fight for hours, submit proof over and over, stay awake all night in an unlivable space, and escalate to multiple agents before they finally issued a refund.

It should not take this much stress and persistence to get basic guest protections enforced. Airbnb markets safety and “peace of mind,” but they do everything they can to avoid responsibility when something goes wrong.

I got my refund in the end — but only after being treated like I was the problem. I’ll think twice before booking with Airbnb again, and I would not trust AirCover without backup evidence and serious persistence."

I booked a new property then took some pictures and left.  I complained to Airbnb , who then began making excuses and inventing bs reasons for why I couldn't have a refund.  
To be clear, when I stated that the place was completely different the only thing that was the same as the Airbnb picture was the bed cover,  everything else was different, even the floor has been changed.  The changes were not for the better, the whole house needed redecorating "

The air con never worked...at all, despite us flagging it on day one. No fix, no relocation, just ""open a window"" and enjoy the sweat lodge. One of our party developed heat exhaustion. The host?
Unresponsive. Aironb? Useless - closed the case against our wishes.
The apartment itself? Filthy. Cobwebs, grime, dust, broken handles. The second bedroom is a boiling shoebox with no curtains, backing onto noisy AC units (that didn't even work).
Drainage is haunted — empty the sink, and the shower gurgles like something's about to crawl out.
We got no sleep, spent our holiday chasing fans and support tickets, and had no help whatsoever. You couldn't pay us to stay here again - although frankly, someone should.
Bring your own AC, curtain, cleaning kit, and a will to live!"
2025-06-26,2,Customer support has gone so far downhill :(,"Infuriating experience with AirBnB. The host required me to sign a short term lease outside of the platform as part of the registration process - after AirBnB had accepted my reservation. This lease was insanely one sided and included a clause that they could refuse to accommodate me for the night and change the dates without any refund to me. The host refused to issue me a refund when I disagreed with this.

This is obviously insanely against AirBnB's policies, so I called support. It was customer support hell for at least 5 hours of my time trying to get the reservation cancelled and refunded. The phone agents literally could not understand what I was saying and refused to look at links to AirBnb's own policies that forbid this. Eventually, their higher level support agent was able to resolve the issue, but this was incredibly draining and took soooo much time.

The sad thing is that I used to have great experiences with AirBnB years ago and their phone support used to be some of the best I've ever experienced. Clearly, customer service is now a bottom priority."

During a monthly stay, I cancelled before my next scheduled payment, had 46 days remaining on the original reservation, and was within both the company's and host's cancellation guidelines to NOT BE CHARGED, and yet I was billed for an unused period of time. When asked why I was being charged, the agent was only able to say that it was for my next scheduled payment. When I asked again, they said it was due to my host's cancellation policy, which they could not tell me where or how exactly it was in the host's policy, considering I had already paid for the period. Then they said it was due to the company's policy, which they sent me, but that policy also did not state why I was being charged when I'd cancelled before my payment was due, and during a period of time I had already paid for.

Lift did not actually exist, stairs were temporary spiral staircases to 4th floor and workmen sealed the door out of appartment at 6am each day. Wifii did not work beyond a tiny space and airbnb did not care either during our stay or afterwards.

Still no money, only open promises and pushing me to phones numbers where no one answers and there’s no voice mail. Then their text customer service is even worse, they text back maybe half the time and it takes a full 24 hours to get any kind of reply. On several of my texts with them they ghosted me completely and then marked the conversation “complete” so I could not text them anymore. I’m done!!!

2025-06-26,1,HOST WARNING: Airbnb's Broken Support System 🚨,"As a long-standing, highly-rated Airbnb host, I’ve always upheld strict safety protocols, clear house rules, and a 5-star hosting standard. Yet I’ve just experienced two alarming situations that show how little protection Airbnb actually offers to hosts when guests violate rules or make false allegations.
🔹 Case 1 – Guest ""P""
❌ Did not provide ID
❌ Never checked in
❌ Booking cancelled by Airbnb
👉 Still allowed to leave a public review against me!
🔹 Case 2 – Guest ""S""
❌ Arrived hours late with an unapproved guest
❌ Refused to provide ID
📹 Refused entry (Ring doorbell footage proves it)
❌ Booking cancelled by Airbnb
👉 Yet again, allowed to leave a review and make false allegations.
I reported these issues, provided full evidence including video, screenshots, booking logs, CCTV , ring camera recordings. London police report (as i had to report ) and house rule violations. Airbnb support seen the guests at fault and accommodation cancelled by them only, but the listings were still suspended, and no meaningful resolution was provided. My reputation and income are impacted — for enforcing safety rules Airbnb claims to support.
💬 Hosts deserve fair treatment, not penalties for upholding safety and platform policies.
📢 Airbnb, this is unacceptable. If you truly value your host community, we need real protections, not silence.
It's just ridiculous. I used them as host and guests for last 9 years with almost all 5 star ratings.

Worse the messaging response is still more dreadful. After having spent almost two hours with 3 separate customer services reps ( the second one got cut off ) trying to resolve a glitch in the Airbnb App the customer services rep said they will call me back after investigating the problem within a hour; they never did. This happened twice. 
Whilst I responded back for an update on the messaging system. It came back offering two telephone numbers in the US.

I reserved it a couple of hours before arrival as we were going through and thought we may stay a few days in town. The owner was rude to begin with on messages.  I let that go as thats just the fact some people are short with you. . We arrived with barely a parking spot to get in. He lived there as well. Which we didnt realize. His vehicles were on the right. On the left was numerous old boats, boat trailers , motors & parts laying everywhere. We barely could fit in.. The place had good reviews. We walked in and It was much smaller than it looked. Basically a split level and someone had maybe cut it in half and made an apartment.  It was dark and basement type smell. The bedroom was very small. It was a 2 bedroom. I read too fast and didnt realize there was only 1 bath.  The pool had sand or dirt all around it and floating on it. The patio furniture was all rusted.  The only good thing was it was by the bay. The plave is not as pictured in the add. Anyway we thought we can't stay here. We instantly text and said if we decided to leave would we be refunded. He said yes. If you arent happy I will give all your money back. If you go ahead and leave so I don't have to pay cleaners. I said yes. We left.  Then after we left went to another place. He would not refund my money. He lied and ssid airbnb wasnt clearing his calender. Airbnb said he would not answer their calls or messages. I have every single conversation with him in screen shots. I have photos, call times, screen shots to prove everything I've said is 100% the truth. Airbnb would absolutely not help me. I called them numerous times, emailed, instantly messaged. Everything. Nothing worked our 1500 dollars gone. My 80 year old mom , a military soldier and myself basically were robbed by Hal & airbnb. Navarre beach, Florida.  2bedroom listing by Hal

2025-06-25,1,Worst platform ever,"Worst platform ever. Do not use it. It automatically took money from my account without any means of verification while it was verifying my newly-created account. And I cannot cancel that booking either. Just use any other platform, not this one."
2025-06-25,1,I am a host with AirBnB,"I am a host with AirBnB. I had a guest stay there and he sent a complaint about a small tear in one of the couches and the sink was scratched up from being old and the hand rail had a mount that needed to be replaced. I offered to come out and fix the hand rail and sink right away which the guest refused. The guest also said ""It was no rush"" and did not want me to come fix the situation, however I could drop off a new couch because I did buy a new one which I did.

After the guest left he contacted AirBnB with literally about 4 pictures. One showed the sink, the other couch and the other the hand rail which he did not want me to fix until he left. They essentially gave him back most of his money of these 4 pictures even though he refused to let me come and fix the problem and even though I actually bought a brand new couch because of the small tear in the bottom of the one that was there.

This is absurd situation as the guest refused to allow me to fix the other SMALL problems and AirBnB essentially allowed him to stay in my house for free because of these small issues that he refused to allow me to rectify."
2025-06-25,1,Bait and switch after Airbnb canceled my reservation...,"Woke up one week before my vacation to find Airbnb had canceled my reservation.  Called and was told the host was ""non-comiant"" with the platform.  I was told I would receive a 15% coupon which I negotiated up to 20% of my canceled booking, amounting to around $500.  I was told the coupon would be sent to my account.  I frantically spent all day searching for a new place and found one just listed that met my needs.  Fearing I would lose it I booked it immediately and called support to find out about the coupon.  I was ignored, I was gaslighted, and I was told they would only give me $300.  No why even though I asked.  I asked if my previous offer was documented.  He replied yes, but they could only give me $300.  Why?  Because that's what they can offer me.  I up to today have been totally happy with Airbnb, but this....canceling my reservation without contacting me, providing an offer to me as compensation then changing that offer with no reason why, and expecting me to be ok with that is a hard NO.  I will be moving away from using them in the future."
2025-06-25,1,Airbnb identity verification is awkward,"Airbnb website requires host's identity verified, but they do not provide a simple way to attach a passport ID photo and send or transfer it to them. Instead AirBNB has an awkward process of snapping a photo of ID with a webcam which never is accepted due to its low quality images that the webcam makes, thus wasting time and creating unnecessary frustration. The second and the only other method is to use your advanced mobile device and deal with an app which I do not know how to do since I do not own an advanced mobile device and only own a $10 mobile phone without browsing or app ability. AirBNB left me with no way to verify my identity and lost me as a customer."
2025-06-24,1,Unacceptable Handling of a Valid Refund Case,"I had a recent experience where I booked an Airbnb listing that was misrepresented in key ways: the internet was unusably slow (2 Mbps on a good attempt, failed entirely on others), the grass was overgrown well above local safety recommendations (posing a tick hazard), and the host admitted the Wi-Fi often needs to be manually reset in a shed — a recurring issue.

After raising these concerns on the day of check-in and deciding not to stay, I was accused by the host of being a “scammer.” Despite providing clear documentation (photos, Wi-Fi tests, screenshots of messages), I was passed around by Airbnb support with no resolution. Over 10 calls, repeated requests to resubmit evidence, and 10 days later, the case was closed with no refund, citing the host’s denial as final.

This experience shows a clear lack of guest protection. Airbnb’s support system was disorganized, dismissive, and ultimately sided with the host despite hard evidence. Very disappointed and will not be using the platform again.

Paid £783.24 in full for my apartment. 11 days to my check in after 24 days of booking I get notified by the host that my accommodation will not be having a pool due to repairs. Then I asked why I am getting to know this now, all they could say is they’re just getting the information now. I requested for some type of compensation and the next thing was that my booking was cancelled. Called Airbnb and requested for compensation as the prices were now above £1300 for similar accommodation and location. Airbnb offered me £156, what a shame. 2nd time I’m using Airbnb and might be the final time I’ll be using them.

Got similar experience with booking,com and I was offered over £600 compensation due to how close it was to my check-in.

2025-06-24,1,"Disappointing Airbnb experience: hidden costs, defects, and poor support","I booked a property in France via Airbnb for four people – but the stay was far from acceptable.

One of the beds was unusable due to broken slats. A second bedroom was locked and only opened upon request – but the window there was broken and couldn’t be opened, making the room unventilated in the summer heat.

Additional charges for the hot tub and linen were only disclosed after booking, hidden deep in the house rules section behind multiple “Show more” clicks. This clearly violates Airbnb’s promise of price transparency.

Despite documented issues and even confirmation from the host, Airbnb offered only a partial refund – part of which came as a voucher, which I did not agree to. My objections were largely ignored.

Airbnb claims to stand for trust and clarity – but in practice, the burden falls on the guest. I strongly advise others to carefully check listings and beware of hidden fees."

' Wash, rinse, repeat.  Over and over and over again.  And if you call them, again, MONTHS later, it is STILL the same reply, over and over again.  NO explanation as to WHY they STILL haven't addressed your problem.  Just 'we are investigating and will get back to you'.  It is beyond frustrating.  Customer service is DEAD.  I remember when Airbnb first began, and it was truly about PEOPLE meeting and getting to know PEOPLE from all over the world.  Now it's all about GREED.  Airbnb leaders should be ashamed of themselves for treating their guests and hosts this way.  Airbnb would be NOTHING without their customers and hosts."
2025-06-24,1,Security Shouldn’t Require Proof — A Plea for Fairness in Unsafe Situations,"Upon arrival, our team encountered an environment that felt genuinely unsafe. All apartment doors in the building were left wide open, and our employees felt threatened and highly uncomfortable due to the behavior of other residents. Given the circumstances, we made the immediate and responsible decision to relocate them to a hotel that same evening and booked a new Airbnb the following day.
The host, Oliver(Scandi'Nest2 Paris), did not offer any support. We had to relocate to a hotel the same night, and booked a new Airbnb the next day. We shared both receipts with Airbnb as proof.
Despite our long-time use of Airbnb for corporate travel and despite the very real safety risk, Airbnb denied our refund request, claiming there was no “proof.”
We respectfully find this decision unacceptable.
Airbnb’s foremost priority is — and should be — guest safety. In situations where that safety is compromised, even without a specific incident being recorded, guests should not be penalized for acting to protect themselves.
We want to emphasize that we have absolutely no incentive to fabricate or exaggerate this experience. We are a loyal Airbnb customer and use the platform regularly for corporate travel. Had we not truly feared for our team’s safety, we would not have canceled the reservation or submitted this request.
We are now left with not only the financial loss of the unused night, but also disappointment in how our genuine concern was dismissed. The absence of physical evidence should not outweigh the reality of a threatening atmosphere that any reasonable person would find distressing.
We ask that this matter be reviewed again at a higher level, with the understanding that guest safety is not always measurable by photos or reports — sometimes it is simply about feeling secure, which in this case, was clearly absent.
Airbnb must take genuine safety concerns seriously — not just when there’s an incident, but when the environment itself presents a clear threat.

My family and I were left in the street and by then it was midnight and the thunderstorm over Paris had picked up. We were frantically trying to find a hotel with availability near by and taxis to carry us there. We got soaked to our underwear trying to do this. It was a horrid experience. 

When we got to the hotel, I immediately contacted Airbnb to request an explanation as to what on earth just happened!! It was 2am and I was wide awake from earlier events!

The hotel couldn’t accommodate for a further two nights (we were in Paris for 3 nights total) so we had to move hotels the next day. We were booked at Versailles palace so had to let our luggage with us on public transport, luckily the palace had lockers to use. By then our wet clothes were packed as they are… 

The next day I receive a call with someone who is clearly uninterested in my dissatisfaction and was trying to wrap up the case with a refund. I requested an explanation and an apology and explained I would be sending receipts for additional expenses incurred like taxis and hotel Vs Airbnb difference. 
I sent this and was then told they are unable to meet my ‘demands’ of £300 refund. Cut a long story short and 3 days later I spoke to 3 different advisors and each had a different response. I ended up complaining on social media and received my payout this morning eventually.

Airbnb is good when things go smooth. One mistake by then and they couldn’t care less and don’t want to help. I found people spoken to have no understanding at all and treated my case like a business transaction. There was 0 care and humanity! 

In conclusion, I wouldn’t recommend even if they pay me! "
2025-06-23,1,In 2024 i tried booking with a host,"In 2024 i tried booking with a host. No response What so ever - even after Airbnb tried to Contact Them. This year 2025 I requested the booking in advance and reached out to the host multiple times months prior to our travel. Still no response. 

I feel it is neglectful of Airbnb to allow a host to be on the platform when they don’t accept any bookings. As one of their so called ambassadors with an account that’s only praised, never any bad remarks I would have expected them to handle the situation better, but no. 

Really considering never using Airbnb again, as this is the 4th time I’ve had an issue. First these two. Then a booking where we arrived and the entire house was beyond dirty and it took them 10 days to come clean, and then another time with a host who wasn’t even allowed to be a host in the complex so we dealt with a lot of angry neighbors. Only once has Airbnb stepped up to help. ONCE‼️ 

Airbnb is turning into a shit show. Find another way of booking because it’s either this or they’ll cancel the booking right before arrival. "
2025-06-23,1,Airbnb Protects Rule Breakers,"Airbnb Protects Rule Breakers, Not Hosts

I’m a host on Airbnb, and my recent experience with their support team was deeply disappointing.

A guest booked my property claiming he would be staying with his wife. Instead, he showed up with a friend and another woman — three people instead of two, clearly planning to throw a party, which violates my house rules. I refused to check them in due to the false information.

In response, the guest left a negative review that had nothing to do with what actually happened.

I contacted Airbnb support to request the removal of this unfair review. For a week, I received nothing but automated responses. Eventually, a representative called me, but their English was extremely difficult to understand. Soon after, my case was closed without any proper explanation.

The only answer I received was:
“According to our policy, the guest acted appropriately.”

So, lying about the number of guests, breaking the rules, and posting a fake review is considered appropriate?

As a host, I feel completely unprotected. Airbnb shows no real concern for facts, fairness, or host rights.
Their policies are vague, support is unhelpful, and decisions are irrational.

This platform no longer feels like a trustworthy place for responsible hosts."
2025-06-23,1,In my opinion I would not ever book again through Airbnb the last minute. ,"In my opinion, if an agency cannot contact its own clients and serve its customers, then why is such an agency needed? People can book their stay directly. This is what happened to my family when we booked a place to relax for a weekend by the sea and the answer was that the owner did not have time for it and the agency with its rules could not contact him, so we were left with nothing. We waited 24 hours for a response to inform us that the stay was canceled. I would not recommend booking through Airbnb to anyone."

I explained everything, but their so called “support” kept demanding “evidence” like I was supposed to predict I’d be falsely accused!! On top of that, I had to deal with a racist neighbour calling me slurs. Airbnb couldn’t care less. Absolute trash. Never using this garbage platform again."
2025-06-22,1,* Traumatic experience in air bnb place ,"

**Title:** Traumatic experience in Pierrefitte-sur-Seine - Paria  – targeted threat in Airbnb apartment


My family and I (including three children) stayed in an apartment in **Pierrefitte-sur-Seine**, just outside of Paris, through Airbnb from June 16 to June 18, 2025. On the morning of **June 18**, just before check-out, we were about to leave the apartment when a man and a woman came out of the elevator and approached us in the hallway.

They first asked if we were tourists, and then if the apartment was an Airbnb. They claimed to be police officers. I asked for their badges, but instead, **both of them showed us pistols hidden under their clothing** and said they needed to check the terrace.

I quickly took my sister-in-law back into the apartment and locked the door as fast as I could. They rang the bell for a while, then eventually left the building. **They only approached our door** – it felt like a targeted encounter.

What made it more disturbing: the building was protected by **three secure entrances** that could only be opened with a key or access code. How they gained access remains unclear.

**We left the apartment in a state of panic with our children.** Our car was in the underground garage where there was no mobile reception. I was so afraid that I didn't even call the police – I just wanted to get my family out of there as quickly and safely as possible.

**Airbnb advised me to write a review and request a refund. I don’t want a refund.** What feels absurd is being expected to write a ""review"" after such a traumatic experience. I reached out to Airbnb so they would **remove this dangerous listing from their platform** to protect other travelers.  

**But unfortunately, the apartment is still available.** In my opinion, this is **deeply irresponsible** on Airbnb’s part. They are supposed to think about our safety – but they don’t, or at least not enough. After what happened, **how can I trust Airbnb again when this listing remains online?**

This is not a complaint in the usual sense – it is a *serious warning*. Please stay alert. Trust your instincts. Nothing is more important than your safety and your family’s "

Someone booked it around the same time. Airbnb or the guy took my money and left me with no flat to rent. They said it wasn't available. OK why would you take my money over a a place is not available anyway? 😡😡😡Customer service says it takes nearly 7 working days! Liars, cheating company! I only had enough to book a place!!! You should be ashamed! I just checked the flat is still available to book! The liar host  advised me to book somewhere else that belongs to him! AVOID! "
2025-06-22,1,DONT USE,Rented an air bnb through them completely opposite of the listing. Had mold leaks in the roof every light in the house flickering off & on loss of power fully
2025-06-22,1,Their customer service is below 1 star.,In order to secure my reservation I needed to verify my identity.  I tried multiple times and it simply would not let me.  My account also said I was verified when I wasn't so it wouldn't let me verify and it also wouldn't let me reserve since I wasn't.  Called customer service for them to basically tell me there wasn't anything they could do.  My advice is to use a website that actually works.  
2025-06-22,1,Should vet info,Goodbye guys. Just ask the host for photos and don’t assume their 110 transactions outweigh the customer’s 17

When I contacted them about delay a week later, only THEN did they even start the refund. Please save yourself hassle and find another way of booking."
2025-06-22,1,🚩 Airbnb failed to protect me as a guest and ignored its own policies,"I booked a stay where the host tried to charge me an $80 pet fee and extra guest charges after booking. Neither fee was included in the price breakdown at checkout, as Airbnb policy requires. The host tried to sneak these in after the fact.

I provided Airbnb with clear proof: screenshots of the price breakdown, policy links, and a timeline of events. Instead of addressing this, Airbnb support:
❌ Gave me conflicting, templated responses
❌ Misrepresented their own policies
❌ Claimed that simply “mentioning” a fee in a listing made it valid (it doesn’t — fees must be included at checkout)
❌ Ignored that no proper alteration request for extra charges was ever submitted or approved

They only refunded me after I fought tooth and nail — and after trying to force me to accept a coupon I didn’t want. Their so-called senior managers closed my case with empty apologies and no accountability for the host.

If you want a booking platform that enforces its own rules and protects guests, Airbnb isn’t it."
2025-06-22,1,AirBNB does not follow their guest refund policy ,"The house I stayed at had multiple issues including major water damage and a mouse infestation. The water damage caused us to leave. I understand that due to the long term stay policy, I technically owe the next 30 days. However, under the guest refund policy, AirBNB should refund me entirely. Instead they are continuously harassing me about further charges for the rest of the reservation. Their customer service is rude and will not help you. I’ve continuously been debating them and they keep reading me a script. All I asked was to not continue the next payments but now due to the harassment, I want all my money back. I will never recommend AirBNB to anyone."
2025-06-21,1,Dont use Airbnb. I rented a property for 3 weeks in Ohio…,"I rented a property for 3 weeks in Ohio Columbus. From the first day I reported multiple issues to the host from filthy rooms, issues with AC, non functioning equipment.

After 1 week of putting up with it I finally reached out to air bnb to complain and to request a cancellation due to the conditions. Absolutely no help whatsoever. The property was not advertised, after looking back on reviews the cleanliness was raised by other renters and clearly nothing was done but the host still maintained the super host status. Absolutely appalling behaviour from air bnb. Looking at the trust pilot reviews it seems they just dont care about there customers..shame on you air bnb "
2025-06-21,1,Misleading support ,"I had a disappointing experience with Airbnb — not just because of the stay itself, but because of how the platform misled me during the support process.

I reported serious concerns to Airbnb early in my stay. A support representative told me I’d be eligible for a 30% refund for the entire reservation — around 20 nights — and advised me to reach back out at the end to claim it. At no point was I told that the only way to receive that refund would be by requesting it directly from the host.

Based on this information, I shaped my actions accordingly: I didn’t escalate further, didn’t press the host, and didn’t gather additional proof — trusting that Airbnb would handle it as they said.

After my stay ended, Airbnb reversed its position. They refunded me only for 2 nights and told me the rest would be up to the host. This was the first time I heard that the platform would not take responsibility for the full refund they initially promised.

If I had been given accurate information, I would have acted differently. Instead, I was misled and denied a fair outcome — not because of what happened in the apartment, but because of how Airbnb handled the situation.

Be cautious: the outcome of your case may hinge more on the individual handling it than on any transparent or reliable process."

They refuse to even look at it u till I provide MY date of birth and MY payment method ( I have no idea what this is ans the account has been inactive for so many years). 
I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was transferred to someone who claimed his name was Batman. He then continued to talk really weird rubbish at me. Apparently this company has no way of investigating fraud. 
I am appalled. My next call is to Action Fraud to report both the host and AirBnB. "

2025-06-21,1,"2 cancelled bookings - 1 day before, and 1 week before. Costing over £3k in damages and left without anywhere to stay tonight","We booked 2 bookings for elderly parents visiting London (7 months in advance), and in walking distance to our home, and both cancelled last minute. One was 4 days before the booking, one was as 1 day before the booking.

I spent over 24 hours on the phone to try and find a replacement and left without anywhere for one day, and had to pay an additional £3k for a 2 week booking. The refund policy means they only refund you the cost of the original  booking (and sometimes up to 20% of the additional cost of a new booking). But, at last minute there is naturally nothing available.

The second booking cancelled 1 day before, and again we would have to pay more to find anything close to suitable.

Any other travel company would look after guests when there is something wrong with the accommodation - book something at the same or better.

Air Bnb policies mean you have to pay when a host cancels, and if you’re lucky you might find somewhere else to stay.

We didn’t find anywhere to live today, and have been left in the lurch with a refund that will arrive in 3 days.

Please don’t ever book air Bnb for any important trips you can’t afford to cancel, or if you aren’t willing and able to cover additional costs for a new booking if your host cancels.

I’ve been left in debt of over £3k, lost days and nights of sleep, and now don’t have anywhere for my mother to stay for the next week.

This is not acceptable and suggest no one books air Bnb until these policies change - hosts who cancel last minute should be required to cover the additional cost for a new booking the guests agree is the same or better than quality.

They suggested my mum stay in a 8 bedroom dorm 6 miles away from me as a replacement.

Their current policies when you book and are treated badly by bad hosts, you must cover the cost to fix what they cancel.  Please keep this in mind.

Here are the two bookings who cancelled last minute to ensure you avoid them.

This host cancelled less than 1 week before a 2 week booking, booked 7 months ago. The original cost was £3,100 and we had to pay an additional £3,000+ to cover another booking that was suitable - with almost nothing available at such last minute notice for a long period in london in June. Do not book this one: “Chelsea Snug with Garden”, hosted by Jonny. 

This host cancelled 1 day before arrival for a 1 week stay which originally cost £1,300, with no rationale or replies to any messages - do not book this one. Property by Capital is the managing host, “ 1 bedroom apartment in Chelsea - RCG”"

Nobody really care that I was with my daughter waiting for an answer. Always reply, sorry and we need to talk to the host, which completely vanishes, even to reply properly to my messages.
I went to the reserve place, no possibility for me to get into the appartment.

This last stay the bedroom smelled like crack smoke. I sent a complaint and Airbnb said I could leave and they would help me find a new place. My family of six packed everything up and left. I then asked Airbnb to help me find a new place and all they did was send me a link to listings in that area, which were all double the price of the one I left. Airbnb told me they couldn’t help me with the price. After hours on the phone they said they would send me 20% off so I could book the cheapest listing which was double what I had paid. I didn’t have the money for it so we had to leave and cut out trip short. Very disappointed "

The lodge itself was very clean and well presented with everything you might need for a self catering holiday, if you don’t want to cook there is a restaurant on the site, yes the menu is fairly basic but it’s well cooked and tasty, the restaurant staff were all very friendly and helpful, and more importantly you can take your dog with you into the bar area. 
The lodge sits in a lovely peaceful park, with some beautiful fishing lakes. 
We will definitely be booking to stay again "
2025-06-19,1,If I could give 0 stars,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. A fake listing meant I had to request a refund. Airbnb sent the refund on the same day, but the refund never cleared. After 12 days, I contacted my bank, and gave them a reference number given to me by Airbnb. The numbers came back with empty transactions - refunds 'sent' but with no monetary value. I proved this to Airbnb, who told me to wait a further 10 days for funds to clear! I waited, and nothing. My bank told me that Airbnb needed to re-send the refund correctly as there was nothing they could do on their end. Airbnb simply refused, and kept telling me time and time again that they had already sent my money and it was no longer their issue. £415 is nothing to a multi-billion pound company, but its a whole lot to a working class disabled person. I've incurred debt on my overdraft and credit card due to being £415 down for so long (and after having to panic book a last minute hotel for my trip, which I then had no money to enjoy). Airbnb are scummy! To allow fake listings and then to also refuse to send refunds is truly disgusting. Avoid at ALL costs."

Also: Everytime I've written a negative review, Airbnb has not posted it, even if it has not violated their policies. 
As reviews can not be trusted I will not use this platform again. "
2025-06-18,1,Home trashed - months later no refund,We had a terrible incident where a tenant trashed our place very badly. We contacted airbnb and they told us they had a policy to protect homeowners. They also told us that we had a claim. All good so far. The only problem is to get them to actually pay you. That part has been impossible. It seems like they say one thing and do completely another.
2025-06-18,1,Scammers unvetted by an unresponsive company,"They don't vet landlords, allowing scammers in the site, without providing any protections to renters. Their customer service is inexistent.

2025-06-18,1,Horrible and traumatizing experience…,"Horrible and traumatizing experience with Airbnb. It’s this actually my second time having a bad experience with this company. I wanted to give a second try but it was WORSE than the first. I requested a full refund for my reservation which I canceled due to serious safety concerns and lack of support from the host. 
A day after making the reservation, 6 weeks Prior to my arrival, I contacted the host to ask specific questions about the area — including how far the listing was from town and what transportation options were available. These were essential for me to feel confident and safe in accessing the location. Unfortunately, I did not receive a response at all. the host was unhelpful in addressing my concerns.
Given this lack of communication and the unclear nature of the listing, I felt genuinely unsafe continuing with the reservation — especially in a country unfamiliar to me and I canceled to protect my personal safety, and I believe this falls within the scope of Airbnb’s Guest Refund Policy, which includes:
“Travel Issues” such as misrepresentation of location or a host failing to provide reasonable access or support. I summited a resolution request, it’s been more than 72hr, and Airbnb has not reach out to Host as per one of their customer service representative I spoke w/ a few hours ago. Airbnb refuses to give me a refund after I spent $1600 with this company. Yes, I cancelled w/this particular Host, when ahead and made 2 other reservations a different Host.
I am requesting that my case be escalated to Airbnb’s Trust & Safety team. I am happy to provide full documentation, including:
Screenshots of my messages to the host
Details about the lack of response
Timeline of my communication and cancellation.
This company should protect its guests as much as its host.
DO NOT trust a company that only cares about getting your money which is what it looks like with this one. God forbid anything happens! My family and son wouldn't know what happened to me or who to contact. Shame on you!
"
2025-06-17,1,Extremely Disappointed with Airbnb’s Handling and Lack of Transparency,"I’ve been using Airbnb for years and always had great experiences—until now. After a terrible stay at a property in Japan, I tried to leave a review within the 14-day window, only to find that the review link was already expired. I had an email from Airbnb clearly stating that June 17 was the final day to submit my review, yet the system locked me out hours before that without any explanation.

When I contacted Airbnb support, not only were they completely unhelpful, but they also blamed the system and told me it was based on the listing’s time zone—a detail that was never mentioned in the reminder emails. That is incredibly misleading and unacceptable for a global platform like this. Users should not have to guess time zones when writing reviews.

I work in tech. I know systems can be overridden—don’t insult your users by saying it’s “system generated and no one can change it.” It’s not a technical limitation. It’s a lack of accountability.

To make things worse, Airbnb showed no interest in escalating the case or taking responsibility, even though I had proof I was within the window. I was effectively silenced from sharing a negative experience due to Airbnb’s lack of transparency and rigid, inconsistent policies.

If this is how Airbnb protects hosts and fails guests, I will absolutely not be using the platform again—and I’ll be sharing this experience publicly to warn others. Truly disappointed."
2025-06-17,1, Title: Absolutely Unacceptable — Airbnb Has Completely Betrayed Its Customers,"My experience with Airbnb has been an utter disgrace. I booked a place that was supposed to have two bedrooms with two beds. Instead, what I received was a lie — only one bed in two bedrooms, and the host claimed it was a ""misunderstanding"" caused by translation issues from French to English. This was clearly a cover-up for a place that was grossly misrepresented.

We arrived and stayed less than four hours before realizing the accommodation was completely unacceptable. We had no choice but to leave immediately and scramble to find a hotel, wasting our time and money. I spent nearly two weeks arguing with Airbnb’s customer service, and all I got was a pathetic offer of a $100 coupon — which is nothing compared to the $1,100 I paid for a five-night stay. After relentless arguing, they finally offered me $250 in compensation, but that’s an insult given the situation.

This company has become a total farce. They no longer care about their customers — only about lining their pockets and protecting hosts at all costs. They accept anyone and anything just to fill bookings, regardless of the quality or truthfulness of the listings. Their customer service is nonexistent, and their handling of this issue was a complete joke.

I am beyond disappointed — I am furious. I will NEVER use this service again. Airbnb has become a scam, a failure, and a betrayal of trust. Stay far away — they don’t care about you."

2025-06-17,1,Horrible experience,"horrible experience. house owners keep sending you cute messages on the private chat asking for a positive review. Once they get their positive review, the start rambling on about how bad conditions you left the house in, how you disrespected the house rules etc. And the worst part is, airbnb does absolutely nothing about this victimisation of the guests. They 100% protect the house owners only. We pay money to get treated horribly."

After being on the phone for over an hour he said ""there's nothing we can do"" and hung up on me. He wouldn't answer any of my questions and would only respond with ""sorry there is nothing we can do"". The greed of the company really shows how they don't care for customers and would rip them off as quickly as possible. They also refused to give me any compensation as a result of the issue too and even had the audacity to ask for a positive review in the survey at the end of our call. They are greedy, unhelpful and a waste of time."

They admitted it must have been a glitch but nothing they can do. Just said make a different reservation as a solution. "
2025-06-16,1,Amenities May Not Be Available,"Prior to being accepted for the AirBnb I was asked several questions by the host regarding the reason for my visit. 5/23/25 I shared that I was visiting my son for his birthday & how important it was as I had not seen him in several years. Friday 6/6/25, the host first contact came in an hour after check-in, while we were still on the road. I was told the pool would not be available until ""Hopefully"" that Sunday. That meant 2 out of the 3 days booked we could not use the pool, but he would be over in the morning to have it fixed. He also mentioned that the renter before me had the same complaint. That meant he knew the pool was unavailable but failed to notify me, in order to give me the courtesy of finding another place to spend my son's birthday. I tried to wait until the morning, but AirBnb said I would have to pay over $600 for the night in a private pool rental with no pool access. Unfortunately, the home was also not cleaned properly. While the hot tub had smudges of dirt in it and unclean walls and rings on the sink, the other bathroom was shockingly unkept with hair in the drain, filthy shower floor & dirty rugs. There was a smell coming from the garbage disposal and obvious cup rings on the table and counter tops.  When I messaged the host, I could see 1/3 reading it. There was no response for the next hour or so via msg. By the time I got a response they were only concerned with photos. No regard to rectifying the issue I was only told that the host has canceled your rental, leave the property. It was 11 pm after a 12-hour drive. We were exhausted and put out on the streets. I am deeply dissatisfied with both the 3 host of the property & AirBnb. They ruined our evening and weekend plans. :-("
2025-06-16,1,Disappointed at the very least,"I am very disappointed after jumping through all sorts of hoops to get a reservation then their not making the connection with my bank, not informing me, and losing the reservation. At this late date I cannot find another at a reasonable price."
2025-06-16,1,"Rigid Policies, Zero Backup — Airbnb Left Me Stranded","I’ve used Airbnb for years, but my latest experience shows the platform no longer stands behind its guests. I accidentally booked the wrong date for a Fairfield Inn & Suites stay via Airbnb. Within minutes I contacted the host, Jason, asking only for a date change—no refund, just one night moved. Jason hid behind “policy” and told me to sort it out with Airbnb.

Airbnb Support confirmed they spoke to Jason, yet claimed their hands were tied because he “didn’t authorize any change.” In other words, the host blamed Airbnb, Airbnb blamed the host, and I was stuck paying nearly US $200 for a room I never used.

Airbnb markets itself as a customer-centric platform, but when a straightforward, good-faith mistake occurs, it provides zero protection or flexibility. Instead of stepping in to resolve an obvious gap in service, Airbnb let rigid policies trump common sense and basic hospitality.

After this fiasco I’ve lost all confidence in the brand. I won’t be booking through Airbnb again, and I’ll advise friends and colleagues to stay away until the company proves it can actually safeguard guests when hosts refuse to cooperate."
2025-06-15,1,Airbnb reviews are irrelevant,"As a long-time Superhost, I’m extremely disappointed by Airbnb’s refusal to remove clearly unfair 1-star reviews. In multiple cases, guests never even checked in — either because Airbnb themselves canceled the reservation due to safety concerns, or the guest missed their flight and had to cancel last-minute.

Despite these situations being completely out of my control, Airbnb chose to keep these damaging reviews on my profile, unfairly hurting my reputation and affecting future bookings. Their system offers no real protection to hosts in these situations, and their support team seems unwilling or unable to apply basic logic or fairness. This is not the kind of treatment a committed host should receive. Airbnb’s failure to act has left me questioning their commitment to supporting hosts at all."
2025-06-15,1,Do not trust ratings in Airbnb website!,One cannot trust Airbnb rating system: some hosts even offer discount if you give them a five star rating. 
2025-06-15,1,very stupid nightly price system,"very stupid nightly price system, in many cases you wil see the nightly price and then they will show that the price is the sum of property price + airbnb service fees. 
but is necesary to check ALWAYS with your math if the total amount is corect, becose many times if you check nightly price that you will paid is bigger.
For these reason in will NEVER use airbnb.com"
2025-06-15,1,Unacceptable and distressing customer service,"Unfortunately our apartment developed a leak during our 5 night stay in Barcelona. This meant the water needed to be switched off at the mains and we would have no running water for showering, toilets etc. We were advised by the host to contact Airbnb about relocating and did so over the phone. 

After the initial call, the customer service representative, Micheal, communicated via live chat. Michael modified our stay from 5 nights to 1 night, providing a refund for the remaining 4 nights. He informed us that we would be entitled to 20% compensation to help relocate. This seemed reasonable, as we had booked 6 months ago and Barcelona was busy with a number of events, meaning limited affordable accommodation options were available. 

However, Michael told us 20% would be £99, on a ~£2.5k booking. I questioned this, and he said that the booking had been modified to 1 night and so we were only entitled to compensation for one night. Without any explanation, and without my consent, he had modified the booking in a  way that reduced the compensation due to us. Calling back, a separate customer service agent was much more helpful. By this time it was 8pm and the agent told us we could book hotel accommodation at a cost of one night’s Airbnb +$200, and that they’d be in touch to help provide alternative accommodation in the morning. I read a message to this agent confirming the content of our conversation, which he agreed to, and which I then put into the live chat as a record. Michael disagreed with the information the second agent had provided over the chat, insisting we could not book a hotel and that the maximum compensation would be £99. A third call to Airbnb was made, the agent this time said that both agents were right, but the hotel accommodation would be subject to approval and that was something that she couldn’t do in the phone. She said that Michael had made a mistake by modifying the booking to 1 night but, that now that had been done, he was correct that we were only entitled to 1 night compensation. Although she said this was Airbnb’s mistake, she said there was nothing they could do about it. I asked to speak to a manager. When the manager finally called me back (by this stage nearly 10pm) he was very helpful. We explained the situation and awaited a further call back from him. In the meantime Michael called and insisted we could only get £99 compensation, disregarding the fact this had been escalated above him and that the manager had said they would be able to reach a better solution. We eventually received a call from the manager, who offered a £500 Airbnb voucher, which was slightly more than 20% of the cost of the stay. By this stage it was 11:30pm. Thankfully the host let us stay that night at their apartment (with no water), as relocating at this time of night would be impossible. We were able to find somewhere on booking.com at a reasonable price to relocate for the remaining 3 nights. We now have the Airbnb voucher which we will need to use within 12 months, so I guess it has still cost us money but we can use that for another stay. 

While the end resolution was acceptable, it was a truly horrible experience. Michael’s behaviour and unwillingness to take accountability for his error in modifying the stay, in a way that reduced the compensation due to us by ~£400, was unacceptable. His attitude was appalling and the experience caused a lot of distress. If the host hadn’t been willing to let us stay, the 23:30 resolution would have left us without accommodation for the night. As it was, staying without water was sub-optimal but at least we had somewhere to sleep. Providing the relocation assistance as an Airbnb voucher, although not entirely unreasonable, significantly reduced the options available to us to relocate with no notice. In the end we paid the extra to book with another provider and will have to use the voucher to recoup that expense on a future trip, despite having zero desire to use Airbnb again after this experience. Sadly based on other reviews, this kind of experience is incredibly common. "
2025-06-15,1,En tant qu’hôte Avis négatif sur Airbnb – Hôte profondément déçu,"En tant qu’hôte Airbnb, je suis extrêmement déçu par cette plateforme.
À chaque location, j’ai constaté que des objets disparaissaient régulièrement de mon studio, et que d’autres étaient endommagés à la fin des séjours. Malgré mes signalements répétés, aucune mesure concrète n’a été prise. 
Mais deux cas en particulier ont rendu la situation intenable :
Un locataire a pris les clés du logement et ne les a jamais rendues. Airbnb n’a strictement rien fait pour m’assister.
Une locataire a gravement endommagé le studio et affirme avoir été agressée par deux individus qui ont aussi volé les clés. Cela a nécessité un changement immédiat de la serrure, et j’ai transmis les factures. Aucune réponse ni remboursement.
Airbnb n’a jamais proposé de solution ou même de conseil.
Aucun suivi, aucune réactivité, aucune protection. Airbnb ne prend pas ses responsabilités envers les hôtes. 
Il est clair que ce qui compte pour Airbnb, c’est avant tout leur commission, pas la sécurité ni la satisfaction des hôtes.
Résultat : un investissement perdant, une expérience épuisante, et un sentiment d’abandon total.
Je déconseille fortement Airbnb à tout hôte qui cherche un minimum de sérieux et de sécurité.

Negative review of Airbnb – Deeply disappointed host:
As an Airbnb host, I am extremely disappointed with this platform.
With each booking, I noticed that items regularly disappeared from my studio, and others were found damaged after guests left. Despite my repeated reports, no concrete action was ever taken.
But two specific cases made the situation unbearable:
One guest took the keys to the property and never returned them. Airbnb did absolutely nothing to assist me.
Another guest severely damaged the studio and claimed she was assaulted by two individuals who also stole the keys. This required an immediate lock change, and I submitted all related invoices. Still, no response and no reimbursement.
Airbnb never offered any solution or even advice.
No follow-up, no responsiveness, no protection. Airbnb refuses to take responsibility for its hosts.
It’s clear that what matters most to Airbnb is their commission—not the safety or satisfaction of their users.
In the end, this was a losing investment, a draining experience, and left me with a deep sense of abandonment.
I strongly advise against using Airbnb for any host seeking professionalism, security, and real support."
2025-06-15,1,AVOID! 10 Years and over 39 properties - they left me in a dangerous apartment and out of money.,"!AVOID USING IN JAPAN!

I have been a customer for 10+ years and purchased 39 Airbnbs. I never once complained about one. I even have 3 more booked already. (These will be the last ones I use)

I arrived in an airbnb in Tokyo and immediately noticed the apartment was not clean at all (a lot of dust and dirt everywhere) and had rising damp issues. I read the Airbnb policy and messaged the host. The host ignored me for over 24 hours.

I noticed the room felt so damp and also began to notice that my throat was sore and my girlfriend was caughing a lot - when we arrived there were little 'water collection' devices and a dehumidifier running, so the host clearly knew there was an issue.

I looked around and searched under posters and saw a lot of black mold and worse and worse damp issues - the apartment was disgusting and the level of black mold is proven to be dangerous to health.

I then messaged Airbnb directly explaining the situation and took pictures. They took so long to respond and when they did they didn't really say anything useful, that we had to sleep another night there. In the morning we told Airbnb we would be leaving because we were concerned for our health. No response for OVER 9 HOURS! I had to book a hotel. (the cheapest possible accommodation I could find, because I didn't have R$5000+ extra in my budget, but I would have to spend it)

Airbnb had offered no help, no alternative, no money. Eventually after we moved to the hotel, they offered me close to a full refund which I accepted. Only then to hours later tell me they actually would not give me that and had 'made a mistake' and would give me much much less than I paid for the original airbnb and less than it cost me to get the hotel and mainly it would come in Airbnb credits!? 

I have followed their policy, sent countless photos and explanations, yet now I have paid twice for accommodation at no small cost, due solely to Airbnb's lack of responses and allowing of a dangerous property to be on their website. So now I have lost well over R$5,000 and they are refusing to refund me this money. Not to mention the countless messages, being stuck without properties or knowing what to do all day, having to move about, destroying my vacation - all I asked for was actually in the end less than a full refund! Less! And I still was denied.

I'm genuinely shocked, as for such a small cost to Airbnb, they could have prevented losing a long time, frequent customer who has spent hundreds of thousands of reais with them and prevented receiving a lawsuit.

It was very clear from talking to the cleaner and seeing how the host was running dehumidifiers (filthy ones by the way) and hiding mold behind posters that the host was very very aware of the mold and damp issues before we got to the property. It now is making me believe that Airbnb may be very aware of this risk too, as the property is still available on their website despite me sending countless photographs as evidence."

Airbnb sided with the host and requested €1,477.91 from me. I refused to pay for something I didn’t do. The process felt very unfair and one-sided.

2025-06-14,1,"Airbnb Left Me Injured, Stranded in the Rain, and Homeless — Then Lied Twice and Walked Away","Airbnb Left Me Injured, Stranded in the Rain, and Homeless — Then Lied Twice and Walked Away

I had been staying in an Airbnb in Vietnam for two weeks when I was involved in a serious motorbike accident. I suffered a broken foot, broken ribs, and open wounds. While I was at the hospital receiving treatment, the host removed the original mattress and replaced it with the exposed raw latex core from inside a mattress — no cover, no casing, just a slab of rubber.

This wasn’t a mistake — it was a deliberate ploy to protect their mattress, clearly intended to avoid damage from my injuries. I was made to feel like a health hazard, not a guest. These latex cores emit formaldehyde, benzene, and other toxic VOCs, and are not safe for direct human contact. I became ill from the fumes and politely asked the host to replace it with a proper mattress again. They were visibly annoyed that I had noticed.

Soon after, they began messaging me aggressively, demanding to see my full visa, despite already having photographed my passport and visa stamp as required by Vietnamese law. This was clearly an intimidation tactic. Eventually, a man came to my room, pressuring me to show my visa and suggesting the police would be called. I was on crutches, in pain, alone, and scared. I gave them my visa out of fear. It was now obvious they wanted me out.

I contacted Airbnb. I provided full documentation, including photos and medical info. Airbnb support agreed the situation was unacceptable. They promised me a refund via coupon, so I could immediately rebook a new property. That’s the only reason I left — I trusted Airbnb’s word.

But as soon as I left the property, Airbnb stonewalled me.

I was left stranded on the street for 9 hours, during rainy season, with:
	•	Exposed wounds
	•	A broken foot and cracked ribs
	•	Crutches
	•	5 heavy bags of belongings

I had nowhere to go, and the promised coupon had not been added to my account. I messaged Airbnb repeatedly. No one responded. I was abandoned in a foreign country while seriously injured, soaking wet, humiliated, and completely unsupported. I had to borrow money just to get a hotel for the night — and that was only the beginning.

Two days later, I got through to Airbnb again. They apologised, said the refund had now been initiated as cash instead of a coupon, and offered partial compensation for my hotel stay. They told me it would arrive in 5–15 working days.

But then — they backtracked again. Within hours, I received another message saying Airbnb would not refund me or compensate me at all, falsely claiming I had “chosen” to leave the property. That directly contradicts their own written instructions.

I am now six days into this nightmare, completely drained — physically, financially, and emotionally. I still have injuries. I’ve had to borrow money to survive, and I’m once again facing homelessness until payday — entirely because I believed Airbnb’s word and acted in good faith.

Airbnb’s conduct has been:
	•	Cruel
	•	Deceptive
	•	Psychologically abusive
	•	And a complete violation of duty of care

They treated me like a problem to be removed, not a human being in need. They made promises, watched me act on them, and then cut me off the moment it was no longer convenient. They left me on the street in a medical crisis.

I am pursuing legal and regulatory complaints through UK, EU, and Vietnamese channels. I have full documentation — screenshots, receipts, chat logs, photos — and I won’t stop until they are held accountable.

If you’re injured, vulnerable, or traveling alone — do not trust Airbnb. When I needed help most, they didn’t just fail me. They abandoned me, misled me, and left me in the rain to fend for myself.

Avoid Airbnb. Your safety means nothing to them."
2025-06-14,1,Bad experience,"Bad experience.

Talking to them on phone is not helpful as they are only concerened about hosts and not 
guests because hosts bring them more money. I can't trust Airbnb anymore and requested to delete my account. "
2025-06-13,1,This was my last booking with them.,"Not sure what's going on with Airbnb, but this is the last time I'm using them.
Out of the last three bookings I made, two were canceled last minute. LAST MINUTE. Here's how Airbnb handled it:

Sure, I understand that things can go wrong and cancellations can happen from time to time. But the real issue here is how Airbnb handles these situations.

First of all, you can’t leave an honest review for an accommodation that cancels on you last minute. I want to warn others about my experience. Why is Airbnb protecting the host and not being TRANSPARENT? Where is the option to leave a review for a place that completely screwed me over?
The money left my account, the transaction happened, so why am I not allowed to share my experience? This is a question for Airbnb.

Second, they clearly do not care about your situation.
The latest cancellation happened in a location where, unless you book in advance, you end up paying more than double the normal rate.

So here I am, arriving with my 5-year-old daughter in front of the accommodation, only to be met with a ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" and a useless €30 credit for a new booking. I had to urgently find another place, pay double the price, and ended up being late for work.

In this case, I expected Airbnb to at least cover the difference I had to pay. But of course, their policy doesn’t work that way. Their policy is to screw you over.

Then at around 11 PM, one of their so-called ""expert"" support agents contacts me to suggest three listings I might consider and apologizes for the situation. Just beyond pathetic.

I’ve used Airbnb for over 5 years.
This was my last booking with them.
I genuinely hope they go bankrupt soon."

Airbnb support kept repeating the cancellation policy and offered a small coupon, even though I lost nearly $2,000. I stayed polite and patient throughout, but there was no real help, no flexibility, and no accountability.

What made it worse is that I was left dealing with all of this across time zones, stressing late at night just to get someone to help. The emotional toll was just as bad as the financial loss.

Whilst I appreciate that Airbnb may have had to cancel the booking / Host for their reasons to look after customers. They should have dine their due diligence in the first place.   They offered to help find another suitable accommodation, however as it was so late in the day, there was nothing in the price range and locality that matched what we had previously booked.   Obviously my family was unhappy.  I though that Airbnb may have gone out of their way to find a suitable accommodation at the same cost to me even if it cost them, as any decent travel company would do, and as I have experienced before with other travel companies.  BUT NO. THEY COULD NOT DO THIS.

After much discussion with Ronald a senior case manager at Airbnb I was offered a figure of £73.77 both verbally and in writing on a number of occasions.  

I decided to take up this offer reluctantly, only to be told that he had made a mistake and that they could only offer $40.   

I have both a verbal and written agreement by a professional company 'Airbnb'.  Both of these are legally binding in the UK where I live, however Airbnb are refusing to keep to their word.

To say I am disgusted is an understatement .

The total cost of my bookings often ends up being much higher than the initial nightly rate due to the added Airbnb service fees. Sometimes, the service fee alone can be a significant percentage of the total price, making the platform less affordable than it appears at first glance.

What's more disappointing is that these fees aren't always transparent until the final stages of booking. It feels misleading, and I wish Airbnb would be more upfront about the total cost from the beginning. While I appreciate the convenience and variety of listings, the high and sometimes unclear service fees make me reconsider using Airbnb for future trips."
2025-06-10,1,"It’s no surprise they have 1.3 stars, i dont see them lasting much longer","Ripped us off entirely, we booked a stay months in advance and 2 weeks before the stay we were told the property had been sold and would have to cancel, Airbnb accepted zero fault, we then rebooked another stay and the host TWO DAYS before our stay contacted us to pay a further £350 security deposit, this was sketchy so we reached out again to Airbnb who agreed, they offered us credit instead of a refund but we said we no longer wished to use them after being messed around, 

They said it would take 3-10 days to get a refund but we still haven’t received it 2 weeks later, they are adamant its been sent, our bank has no record of a incoming transaction

Said family did not have to leave as she could have gone in and fumigated even though the guests included children, babies and unborn baby! Worryingly, since she admitted she already knew of the problem and it would have been hard for this not to be the case, presumably she had fumigated prior to arrival. She then threatened against any bad review. No wonder house is being sold by owner; she and her property not fit for purpose. Don't always know what you're going to get or the risk you are taking to be there while leaving a well-earned break somewhat to chance. "

The host was listing the same apartment under multiple accounts and double-booking it, which was very concerning. Thankfully, Airbnb acted reasonable, protected me, and canceled my reservartion without any penalties. Their customer service was professional and understanding — I felt genuinely supported. Great job keeping guests safe!

I didnt see any signs of actions taken to remove those duplicate housing offers, but at least taking case up before my trip started, attaching all screenshots and host not responding within 48 hours, the case was resolved in my favor."

When we checked in, we realized that the host has given fraudulent information about the property, such as distance to the beach and Mall, amenities etc. The host was lying about everything. We had to leave the property and requested for refund to Airbnb, but got no reply after several attempts. All I got was auto reply.

2025-06-08,1,Account blocked without explanation — left stranded and unsupported abroad,"I am a Ukrainian citizen who has been living in different countries due to the war, including Canada and Ukraine. I had relied on Airbnb for several years without any issues — I even received humanitarian housing support from them in 2022.

Recently, my account was suddenly deactivated without any clear explanation after I tried to book a short stay using a Ukrainian bank card that I had used before. I had verified my identity, provided my Ukrainian passport, Canadian address, and submitted two valid bank cards under my name.

After the deactivation, I was left without accommodation abroad, unable to contact my host or manage my existing bookings. Airbnb only sent vague, automated responses and refused to explain what rule I had supposedly broken.

I wrote a detailed and respectful letter asking for a proper review, but received another copy-paste message saying my account would stay deactivated — permanently.

This caused significant emotional stress and travel disruption. It made me feel completely unsafe and unsupported in a vulnerable situation. I feel like I’ve been unfairly targeted simply for using two valid cards or for moving between countries.

Airbnb claims to support displaced people, but this experience made me feel the opposite — ignored, flagged, and excluded by a system that offers no humanity or transparency."

I had a terrible experience as a guest when I stayed briefly in Rionegro, Colombia. I was trapped inside a host’s apartment due to lack of check-in instructions, and there was mold in the bathroom, no toilet paper, and poor sanitation. I reported these issues to Airbnb with videos and photos and received partial compensation.

But after the host was notified of my complaint, she falsely accused me of stealing a remote control and posted a negative review full of personal attacks, dismissing my experience. Despite my final appeal and strong evidence of retaliation, Airbnb refused to remove the review.

I am a respectful guest with a clean record who only stayed a few hours during a layover. This review has damaged my reputation and Airbnb closed the case without proper protection. I followed every policy, yet the platform failed to uphold its own standards.

Guests deserve safety and fairness—especially when reporting serious problems. Airbnb’s system allowed a false, retaliatory review to stay on my profile. Very disappointing and unfair."
2025-06-08,1,Airbnb Is Protecting Fraudulent Hosts and Exploiting Guests — Unethical & Infuriating,"I’m absolutely disgusted and angry with how Airbnb has handled my recent experience. I booked a stay where the host locked me out in the heat, failed to provide a working key, and repeatedly invaded my privacy by constantly coming outside and watching me — making me feel harassed and racially profiled.

Out of courtesy and empathy (because they had children), I chose not to file a complaint at the time. Huge mistake.

After I checked out, the host falsely accused me of smoking marijuana inside the home (not true), left a retaliatory and defamatory review on my profile, and filed a fraudulent damage claim against me for a so-called “smoke odor” and cleaning costs — which are, in reality, the host’s responsibility between guests.

Airbnb’s response? They demanded $211 for “cleaning,” refused to show me any real evidence, cited “confidentiality,” and pressured me to pay within 24 hours, threatening my account. They ignored everything I provided about the host’s misconduct, refused to remove the false review, and dismissed my concerns entirely.

This company sides with lying hosts to avoid using their insurance and makes guests pay for costs they should never be responsible for. When I requested fairness, they offered to reduce the charge if I paid quickly — essentially a shakedown.

To make things worse, when I asked for proof of damages, receipts, or inspection records, Airbnb repeatedly refused. I even told them the host’s husband kicked in the door to let us in after we were locked out, yet that somehow didn’t matter.

Let’s be real: Airbnb has created a system where guests are vulnerable, blamed, and exploited, while dishonest hosts are protected and rewarded. I have no trust left in this platform. It’s unethical, manipulative, and fraudulent.

Shame on Airbnb."

The host cancelled the stay 3 weeks before arrival - and listed the accommodation again for the same dates and prices. I paid 565 euros and when I searched for similar accommodations the prices were at least 1K euros. The solution from Airbnb? 20 euros voucher and not even a sorry for the bad experience. What am I supposed to do? This company is a joke.

I raised this immediately and was met with vague, scripted replies. No one took accountability. I objected in writing under GDPR Article 21, citing that the upcoming review is inaccurate and reputationally harmful (Art. 5 & 6), and they still refused to block it.

I have now filed a formal complaint with the Irish Data Protection Commission.

This is not a refund issue — it’s a serious data protection failure and violation of guest trust. If you’re considering using Airbnb, be warned: your personal information and public reputation are not safe with them.

2025-06-06,1,Reviews are removed ,"I used to live Airbnb, but they have lost my trust. After a recent nightmare situation where I was scammed by a host I found out that Airbnb had removed my review allowing the host to continue scamming others. The support team I spoke with was completely useless. You cannot trust reviews on Airbnb. They remove anything unfavorable to artificially inflate listings. Do yourself a favor and book elsewhere!"
2025-06-06,1,So disappointing ,"I am so upset by my recent experience with air b n b. Ive been a customer for years and i travel regulary for work and leisure. I went to Turkey and had such a terrible experience with a host. The place was full of mould, the balcony doors didnt lock ad most importantly for me I had specifically asked for the wifi speed to be 100mbps because of the work I needed to do. It was even verified in an internal message we had together on air b n b. Due to the situation I had to cancel the booking and find somewhere else. I was advised to contact the host first, which I did and as it was the evening I did not expect her to resolve it until the morning. I stated this in a text message and showcased it to air b n b. The host agreed to a refund in the morning and I left to another place. I then get the most awful review on my air b n b profile that includes completely false information about me and the experience. The host accused me of not paying (which is impossible because you cannot book a place without paying) , tht I got angry with her in the night because she didnt reply, which was also not the case as we had amicable messages and as Id already explained I didn't expect her to respond until the morning. I contacted Air b n b to get the review rebuked because it goes against policy to have false information in a review. They rejected my three attempts of filling in the form for this and also the customer service team basically said they cannot do anything even though they agreed that the information was false and its not helpful to me to have this awful and false review on my profile. If you have a policy, the policy should be abided to and you should care about your paying customers reputation in the matter. Who wants a review that is completely false and abusive on their profile?"

2025-06-06,1,Review of AirB&B,"Review of AirB&B: A Deep Disappointment After Years of Loyalty

I had been a long-time and loyal user of AirB&B. With over 20 trips around the world under my belt, the service had always left a positive impression. Not only did I use it myself, but I also recommended it to friends, acquaintances, and in my blog with over 3,000 subscribers. I trusted AirB&B because I believed that even in a difficult situation, they would have my back. And in the past, they did — during trips to Venice and the US, when accommodations turned out to be uninhabitable, the AirB&B team always found a solution quickly and covered the cost difference for new accommodation.

However, my experience in Paris in May 2025 was a real shock and disappointment.

I planned to celebrate my birthday on May 28 in Paris with my mom and friends. Two months in advance, I had booked what I thought was a great place. But on the day of check-in, everything went wrong. The host didn’t respond to my messages or calls. I was only able to reach him through AirB&B’s support team. When we finally entered the apartment, we were horrified: it was dirty, there were holes in the walls and furniture, vomit stains on the floor, and no clean bedding. The host offered us used sheets with visible hair on them, insisting they were “fresh.” The apartment was booked for three people, but for the third guest, all he provided was a thin blanket — no pillow, no proper bedding.

Wires were hanging out of the walls, and the bathroom was in a disgusting condition.

I contacted AirB&B support and sent photos, explaining everything in detail. And what did I get in return? A voucher for 20% off my next booking. No real help. I was told to find a new place on my own, pay for it out of pocket, and wait up to five days for a refund of the ruined booking. The problem was — I didn’t have enough money available to do that, especially in one of Europe’s most expensive cities. After several calls with support, the only thing they could offer was a voucher worth 50% of the original booking. That was it. I was left standing in the street with my mom and our luggage on my birthday.

Luckily, I managed to find a last-minute alternative — it was twice as expensive, but at least it was clean and functional. Out of ten hosts I contacted, only one responded. I nearly ended up spending the night outside, with my mom, in Paris, on my birthday.

So what’s the takeaway? I am extremely disappointed. While the support agents were polite and sympathetic, they were completely powerless and unable to help. The quality of service from AirB&B has significantly declined. They no longer offer the safety and support that used to set them apart. I will no longer use this service, and I absolutely won’t recommend it to others. Fortunately, there are now many other platforms to find accommodation.

I hope my experience helps other travelers avoid this kind of situation, save their nerves and money, and not end up stranded in a foreign city on a special day."
2025-06-05,1,PRICE YOU SEE IS NOT WHAT YOU PAY,"While searching for a place to stay a pop-up showed on the screen stating the price you see ($640 for the one I booked) is the price you pay. NOPE!! I was intimately charged $778.35. Contacted host, she couldn’t help. Called AIRBNB and couldn’t even get anyone on the phone or thru chat. Never again!!!!!!"
2025-06-05,2,French bookings are a nightmare,"I am normally very happy to book with Airbnb, but booking French properties is an absolute nighmare. You need to wait for confirmation of the booking, and in my experience 80 per cent of the properties are not available for booking, yet they are listed for the dates you look for. They take payment and then you have to wait around a week for the refund. I am currently looking for a property in the Alps, and 5 properties have rejected my request for different reasons, mostly because they have not updated their prices for the next ski season, but they haven't bothered to remove the listings. What a waste of time. Airbnb should not allow this, it makes it very frustrating and time consuming to look for accommodation, in fact I given up, I will look elswhere,"
2025-06-05,1,Terrible customer serivce! Practically useless!,"Wow, Amazed to see a company so well-known that has 1-star reviews, but I agree. I have had so many glitches on the website as a host. The last one was that a host would see a different price, like a third of my price, than on my hosting site. I even screenshared this unexplainable situation,  but no one took responsibility. I lost many bookings. Then you spend hours with supervisors with no authority to do anything, who sit in the Philippines and cannot solve any problem as they are not authorised to. No compensation, no explanation why this happened. Then, often my calendar is blocked without me having touched it. I heard many times how sorry they are, and that is it. I feel Airbnb is on decline, and as many countries now will ban it the business model is failing. Making billions on the back of frustrated customers is not going to be viable!"
2025-06-05,1,Airbnb ignores its own policies and offers no real support for hosts,"I’m an Airbnb host who received a retaliatory, bad-faith review after I declined a guest’s request to extend their stay. The review focused heavily on lighting and blinds (over 50% of the content), gave 3 stars for location, check-in, and value — despite no complaints during the stay and the use of Airbnb’s automated smart lock system in a central Austin location.

I submitted proof including screenshots and listing photos. Airbnb denied the removal request without explanation and told me there was no way to contact the Reviews Team — then redirected me to a feedback form. As a disabled veteran small business owner, this hurts both financially and reputationally.

Airbnb claims to protect hosts from irrelevant and retaliatory reviews but refuses to enforce its own Review Policy when it matters."

2025-06-04,1,Airbnb Charges You Before Payment Is Due – Breaching UK Consumer Law,"I was shocked to find Airbnb charging my card for upcoming bookings a full week before payment was actually due — even though the hosts’ policies clearly allow free cancellation up to 24 hours before check-in.

This isn’t just poor practice — it’s deceptive, coercive, and potentially unlawful under UK consumer protection law. Specifically, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 prohibit charging for services before a legal obligation exists. Airbnb’s “charge now, refund later” approach ignores your cancellation rights and shifts the financial risk onto you.

Moreover, the card Airbnb used for the charge was only used once for a reservation fee and was never designated as a stored or default payment method on my Airbnb account. My Airbnb profile explicitly lists a different card as the authorised and stored payment method. Yet Airbnb used a card I used for a one-off payment without my consent.

When I raised the above issues, Airbnb kept using arguments irrelevant to my complaints (e.g. but you're eligible for a refund anyway) and completely ignored the not authorised card issue.

Airbnb clearly knows better. For a company this size to flout basic consumer protections is unacceptable. I’ve filed a complaint with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and urge others facing similar practices to do the same.

I expected more from a platform that claims to empower guests. Instead, I got a forced transaction based on terms that hadn’t even taken effect yet.

Be warned: Airbnb may charge you before your booking  is even due and use payment methods you never consented to — and against their own stated rules."
2025-06-04,1,Another failed experiment ,"Once a nice community has once again became corporate greed. No protection whatsoever for hosts nowadays. Fraudulent ‘insurance’ system, incompetent customer care somewhere deep in Asia, where they barely speak English. Shame on you. "
2025-06-04,1,They don't protect their customers,"An host asked for 1000€ of refund for a damage I didn't do. It's about a sofa bed which I didn't even open and the only person sleeping on the couch was a 10 year old girl. They claimed there was a damage to the infrastructure. This is just impossible. Airbnb didn't even consider anything and just asked to me a reimbursement. We'll see in court because I didn't even touch the sofa and I want to see how they can prove I broke it. By the way, this host even gave me 5 star review because I left the flat completely immaculate, actually better than how we found it. This host has a dozen of apartments all around Paris and they are making millions and keep proposing discounts for giving them 5 star reviews."
2025-06-04,1,Worst company on this planet,"Worst company on this planet. Very unethical! It was discovered that there was a hidden camera by my daughter and airbnb did nothing about it! Did not return any money or move her to a safer location, Airbnb is a JOKE!!! Not only this, but there was severe dirt and even rat droppings around this airbnb that she discovered and again, AIRBNB did nothing! The craziest part is that my daughter was shocked and did not leave a review since AIRBNB didn't care and then the owner of the property left a BAD review on my daughter because she had tried to resolve these very big issues. Airbnb are criminals. Use VRBO from now on!"
2025-06-04,1,I’m really disappointed with how Airbnb…,"I’m really disappointed with how Airbnb handled the photo process for my experience listing. I agreed to participate in a professional photo shoot, but I was never given the chance to approve the final images before they were published even though it’s my face, my experience, and my business.

Some of the photos don’t reflect how I want to represent my work, but Airbnb refuses to remove them, saying they’re “pro images” controlled by their internal team. I worked hard to build a five-star listing, and now I’m being told my only option is to delete the entire listing and start over, losing all my reviews.

It’s unfair that hosts don’t have more control over how we’re presented on a platform we help build. I expected better."

I have used airbnb for 10 years and had a profile. I was so happy that i recently became a host. This has been a absolute nightmare.

The platform itself has transferred my old phone number from my traveler profile to my newly created host profile. This phone is 10 years old and not in use, there is no way for me to get this from my phone provider.

This means that guests can not reach me. 
I can not add my bank details to my account to actually receive any pay outs from my rentals.

I have been in contact with Airbnb support several times and offered passport verification,bank verification,dob,proof of adress in order to change the phone number.

After speaking in the phone in several occasions the response is that if i cant get the phone provider to activate this number then the money will stay with AirBNB. 

They say that i should add a family member as a co-host and get the money to my family members account for future bookings. (I live alone) 

They say that for bookings that has already been checked out i will not be able to get that money unless that specific phone nr is magically activated after 10 years. 

Did not expect this at all."

2025-06-03,2,"Airbnb’s Review System Encourages Pressure, Not Honesty","As a frequent Airbnb user, I’ve noticed a troubling trend: many hosts now push hard for 5-star reviews - sometimes through messages, signs in the home, or follow-up pressure after your stay. It’s clear this is driven by Airbnb’s algorithm, which seems to only value perfect ratings.

This creates a fake sense of quality. Some listings are overrated because guests feel uncomfortable giving anything less than 5 stars, even when the stay was average. I’ve even experienced hosts offering small gifts or guilt-tripping messages to “earn” that perfect score.

Airbnb should consider a fairer system, like a Net Promoter Score (NPS), where guests anonymously share whether they’d recommend a place. This would promote real feedback and better experiences for everyone.

Until then, take glowing reviews with a grain of salt, many are more about keeping the peace than telling the truth."
2025-06-03,1,I've been a host since 2017,"I've been a host since 2017. I've achieved super host status for the past 3 years, and I've kept it. However, recently I was involved in a very unfortunate situation that put my life in jeopardy.  Although I had an active contract, the scammers took over the house by force with firearms.  All my 4 guests were out , 
So the Venezuelan crooks gave them their belongings on the curbside just like they did me 43 days after taking over the house.  While giving this particular guests her belongings they've fed her lies about me occupying the house illegally, which is not true at all, and I can prove it.  In revenge, she left me a false review on airbnb accusing me of been a scammer and occupying the house illegally which is totally inaccurate. 
 Although my pleas to airbnb to take down the false review and allow me to present my case and provide them with necessary paperwork proving my innocence, they would nor budge.  I feel victimized by Airbnb all over again while 
supporting false accusations. I need HELP."

When I cancelled I asked the hosts (Marie and Maria) about getting it cancelled and was told that I had to go through Airbnb because I booked through them. I contacted Airbnb and cancelled, then was told I wasn’t getting anything back. They also told me that the host had to make the final decision. I reached out to them and the denied my request!! I reached back out to Airbnb and told them I didn’t think it was fair and they said the host was firm in me not getting any money back so I reached back out to her and she said it wasn’t her but was Airbnb that wouldn’t let me get my money back. If you are planning a trip to Williamstown Kentucky and are booking through Airbnb, watch out for this with Airbnb and the hosts (Marie and Maria) that screwed me over!!"

That was fine so I asked what the reasons were. They says they couldn’t tell me. Wrong. Under GDPR UK law, I am entitled to that information and they have refused 3 times. I’ve gone round and round in circles.they are breaking the law. A company such as this should know better "
2025-06-02,1,Absolute scammers,Absolute scammers! Second time I’ve been scammed by showing up at a room that was nothing like the pictures. Deff never using this again. Use booking.com
2025-06-02,1,Poor slow communication,"Poor slow communication. Even in the face of irrefutable evidence they will stick with the same rehearsed lines. 

E.g I’d set up a new listing for my space, not realising my old property management company that I’d decided to move on from hadn’t taken their version down. Despite showing them the trail of correspondence, my proof of address and property ownership they decided I was the fraud and suspended me for two weeks. Costing me significant bookings at peak holiday. Only unblocked me after the company delisted the old listing 

Latest issue was after turning on instant booking I had a reservation six months out come in. It was a weekend I hadn’t realised had become unblocked - as soon as I realised I spoke to the guest. But Airbnb requires the host to cancel in this situation - and this is quite costly both financially and in terms of superhost. I have an average 4.95 rating and have never cancelled. And of course I would have honoured the guest if the booking was within two to three months. But six months is ample to find an alternative space. Airbnb charges me $85 which is a quarter of the payout I’d have received. I also lose superhost status as they only allow cancellation rate of 1 per cent. Which as a new space and only 20 bookings in six months - will take me YEARS to regain. 

Guest doesn’t get the fee as compensation. Airbnb does! 

Also just seems unfair when they actively encourage you to have flexible cancellation policies for guests. 

And while I understand it can’t be the same flexibility for hosts - I think there should be some scope for cancellations beyond a reasonable time frame.

2025-06-02,1,Extremely Disappointed with My Recent Experience,"I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction with the recent experience I had on your platform, which has been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing.
This situation began with the host I booked accusing us of causing damages to their property—an accusation we were only informed about after we had checked out. The photos provided as evidence are questionable and inconsistent, yet we are being asked to pay for these alleged damages.

I took the appropriate steps by raising a case, only to discover later that it was closed without our knowledge because Airbnb had already settled it. To make matters worse, the host left a negative review on my profile, and your customer service team has done nothing to address this or to remove the unjust review.
This entire experience has left me feeling that your platform is far from customer-centric. The lack of support and resolution in this matter is unacceptable, and I am left with a very bad impression of your service."
2025-06-02,1,They take your money n tell you there's nothing they can do,"Outstanding customer advisors who are thorough and pleasant despite lmited capabilities.

2025-06-01,1,Airbnb is full of scammers,"Airbnb was good in the past, but now it has turned into a scam website. Many scammers there. 
And the worst part is that Airbnb does not accept responsibility. You are on your own if the host is fraud and does not refund your money. "
2025-06-01,1,"After 12 years and 68 trips, Airbnb left me unprotected","I’ve been a loyal Airbnb guest for over 10 years, with 90 completed trips and 68 positive reviews. Until now, I’ve had nothing but great experiences — but this latest incident has completely destroyed my trust in the platform.

During a recent stay in Normandy, France, the host left a false and hostile review, accusing us of “refusing to pay,” claiming “food on walls,” and even mentioning “blood” and “worms” — none of which are visible in the photos she provided. In reality:
	•	I proactively offered to pay in person
	•	I reiterated the offer via message
	•	I paid the full €50 she requested through Airbnb — even though Airbnb later told me I wasn’t required to pay at all

The tone of the host’s messages after checkout was friendly, even thanking us — until we questioned vague extra charges. Only then did her language become erratic and personal. The retaliatory review was posted after I disengaged from the accusations.

Airbnb refused to remove the review, despite their own policies against retaliation and false claims. I escalated through customer support, emailed legal, and used their official review dispute tool — all to no effect.

To be called “a nightmare” after 10 years of positive history, during a time when we were between homes with two small children, is incredibly hurtful — and the fact that Airbnb sided with the host anyway shows where their priorities lie.

I will no longer be using Airbnb. I’m sharing this not out of spite, but to warn others: if something goes wrong, Airbnb will not protect you."
2025-06-01,1,15000 reviews and a score of 1.3,"15000 reviews and a score of 1.3. The profile is claimed by the company, meaning they receive the negative feedbacks. They just don't care! Untouchables, they do whatever they want at this point. Airbnb is offering services that are completely against the legislation for accommodation, and again, nothing happens. This company should be banned! First they were forced to move me one month ago, when I rented a place that has nothing to do with the beautiful pictures. It was a war and they just made the decision when I was in danger. Gave them one more chance, and guess what? I'm literally staying in a place with cockroaches running up and down, a huge infestation, but that's ""not a problem"" according to their customer service. I hope this company goes bankrupt as soon as possible. Hotels charge high for a reason."
2025-06-01,1,Canceled with no notice ,"My reservation was canceled without notification.  It was already paid for.  No one from Airbnb cared or had any solution for my situation.  I have been using this service for years and have referred it to others.  I would never think i would be left out in tge cold like this.  I will share my experience.  If i would have canceled, i would be charged %50 Cancelation fee but i was basically told to  just deal with it.  There is nothing we can do for you.  Wait 10 days to get your $ 800 dollars back and then you can make another reservation.  That reservation could be canceled also. So disappointing!!! "

2025-05-31,1,AirBnB supports dishonesty!,"Airbnb let me down.

I’ve been a Superhost for a while. I take pride in how I run my place—clean, respectful, always ready for the next guest. I’ve hosted dozens of people, earned 5-star reviews, and built everything on trust and effort. But none of that seemed to matter when something went wrong.

I had a guest who wasn’t honest. They lied about how many people stayed. That should’ve been enough to question everything else—but Airbnb gave their version more weight than mine. I brought up the facts. I followed the process. Still, they left the review up.

It felt like I was left out to dry. All that hard work, all the consistency, and the reputation I’d built—swept aside in favor of someone who didn’t play by the rules from the start.

This changed how I see the platform. Hosting through Airbnb has always been about trust, but now I’m not sure that trust goes both ways. If you’re a host, know this: no matter how solid your track record is, it can take just one dishonest guest to flip everything—and Airbnb might not be there for you when it happens.

I have always been a respectful guest, with good reviews, I have never broken a single rule! I had rented a house for my vacation in Mykonos 3 months in advance through the platform and it was already paid for, my trip was all set with accommodation and tickets paid for. Until Airbnb decided to ruin my vacation, they simply canceled my reservation and deleted my account for no reason, no explanation, causing me to lose my reservation and now with little time left for the trip I can't rent another place that fits my budget and is of the same standard, which could cause me to postpone or cancel the trip! Thank you for ruining my Airbnb vacation, you are a trash company!"
2025-05-31,2,Not giving a s*** about loyal customers,"In many countries the price to quality ratio is better that on other platforms. 

Their customer support is horrible though. They had an error in one of the booking, and instead of providing another accomodation quickly they made me wait. I missed an expensive tour non-refundable and I had to book another accomodation last minute which was very expensive because of them. I'd expect them to value their loyal customers more. 

I've been using it for more than 6 years and made a lot of bookings lately. But this stops today. I'd rather use booking.com. "

Airbnb provided no alternative accommodations and told us to find a hotel ourselves. We incurred unplanned hotel costs and endured serious emotional and physical hardship, especially for my father. Despite this being a direct failure by Airbnb (not a host cancellation), they offered only $125 — just 20% of the reservation cost. I’m demanding full reimbursement, appropriate compensation, and a formal apology for this unacceptable breach of duty and care."

Review:
A guest booked for 5 people, but turned-up with 11, held a house and pool party, and filmed a video shoot all of which violated our listed our house rules. We asked her to pay for the extra six guests, and in response, she left a 1-star retaliatory review.

We submitted video evidence to Airbnb showing the violations, but they refused to remove the review. Also while writing our response, Airbnb’s system logged us out and posted an unfinished reply, which now damages our listing further.

Despite escalating the issue, Airbnb’s staff and senior case managers defended the guest, ignored their own policies, and showed no understanding of customer service or business impact. As a result, we received no bookings since then. Airbnb has wholly failed to support us as hosts. I am so shocked that as a public limited company they hired staff that cannot even think out of the box. I will be taking legal proceeding against airbnb."
2025-05-30,1,Frustrating and Unhelpful Customer Support Experience,"Airbnb’s customer support feels slow, inconsistent, and heavily scripted. It often seems like agents are limited in what they can actually do, and issues get passed around without real resolution. There’s little sense of accountability or urgency, and it’s hard to feel genuinely supported as a guest. Communication needs to be clearer, more human, and more action-driven."

It's convenient because we usually travel in groups and with a house, everyone can stay together comfortably. This enables us to enjoy activities together and save money on food by cooking some of our own meals.
The only thing I don't like is that as a secondary guest, I can't leave my own review on their site. Only the person who made the reservation can do that and it bites. Every adult guest should be able to share their own experience."

When we received the actual address of the house it's on the other side of the street so you have to cross the main road to ""walk"" to the beach and it's in the middle of the town behind a hotel and brewery.  It's not anywhere close to the location that was represented.  Of course by the time we were given the actual address it was less than a week before our trip and past the cancellation date.  We asked the host about the address and she told us that Airbnb does not have the location correct and that she has asked them to correct it.  There is no mention in the posting that the address is incorrect.  We contacted AirBnB customer support and were told that  they don't show the actual address and since it's less than a mile from where they showed it to be they would not less us cancel the booking.  We picked this house and paid an extra $800 based on the location.  Being next to the beach and being almost a mile away is a huge difference and is not a proper representation of the locations.  Don't ever use AirBnB.  Go to VRBO or another site."

This is completely unacceptable.

I relied on Airbnb’s credibility and service quality, but what I experienced today was nothing short of negligence. No one was available to help, and no action was taken to ensure I could access the property or find an immediate alternative.

I am honestly very angry. This kind of experience not only ruined my day but also made me question whether Airbnb is truly reliable when travelers need it most."

2025-05-28,1,"Title: Airbnb Penalised Me £2,750 for a Guest Who Missed Her Flight – Now Holding Me Liable","I’m a host and Airbnb applied a £2,750.71 negative balance to my account — for a situation that wasn’t my fault.

My guest missed her flight and couldn’t arrive on the agreed check-in date. I offered to help with new dates or cancellation to make things easier. I genuinely thought Airbnb would handle the refund through their guest protection — not take the money from me.

What happened next shocked me:
	•	Airbnb processed the cancellation and paid me.
	•	Later, they also refunded the guest.
	•	Then they applied a negative balance to my account, as if I now owe them £2,750.

I never knowingly agreed to this. There was no warning, no consent, and no explanation that I’d be personally liable if Airbnb made payout mistakes. I simply tried to be flexible.

Now I can’t host again unless I repay the full amount — for a guest who didn’t show up.

This is:
	•	Host exploitation
	•	Misuse of refund systems
	•	A breach of transparency and fairness

I’ve filed a GDPR Subject Access Request and will escalate this to the UK ICO and Competition & Markets Authority. Airbnb has refused to resolve this through support. This is how they treat hosts trying to help guests in good faith."

Overall my experience with Air BNB properties has been awful, including this last one (Oak Knoll Cottage in Prescott, AZ). I have stayed at over 2 dozen properties the last 6 years and have been burned by Air BNB and hosts one too many times. Only 2 properties have been good during that time. Most have been disgustingly dirty, not as advertised in some important way, or the host ends up sticking us with extra fees that we didn't incur (such as damage or stains caused by prior occupants). Air BNB always takes the side of the owner on those. One owner even had hidden ""security"" cameras INSIDE the unit to watch occupants while they were there. Yes, INSIDE. Please beware of this company and its hosts. At the very least you run the risk of dirty properties or getting stuck with fees that are not yours to pay. I'm disabling my account and going back to staying in hotels I trust and can easily research ahead of time."

(Worse than HMRC, which I never thought was possible). My time has come to abandon this company and warn others. It works well, until it doesn’t. Then you are completely left alone and abused whilst they suck the time and energy to the point where you simply have no choice but to give up.
Worst of all, they won’t publish your reviews. If negative, so that hosts are protected and they continue to profit. One of the most manipulative companies that exist today. True masters in the dark side of abusing the consumers wallet & time."

2025-05-23,2,Airbnb Ignored Clear Policy Violations – Harmful Review Left Up,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb host and have always tried to maintain a high standard for my guests. But I recently faced a deeply frustrating experience that I believe every host should be aware of.

A guest left a review that included false and damaging claims, including:
	•	Speculation about hidden surveillance devices (with no evidence)
	•	A false statement that my listing was an “entire home” when it’s clearly listed as a guesthouse
	•	No issues raised during the stay — only false allegations made after checkout

I submitted two formal requests for removal, clearly referencing Airbnb’s own Review and Content Policies (which prohibit false or misleading content and unsubstantiated accusations). Both times, I received what felt like automated responses with no real explanation.

Eventually, I was told the case was closed and the decision couldn’t be overturned — despite the review clearly violating the rules. This has had a real impact on my family’s small business, and I no longer feel protected as a host.

Airbnb encourages hosts to be transparent and professional — but when the system fails to enforce its own policies, that trust breaks down. I hope Airbnb re-evaluates how it supports its host community in situations like this."

2025-05-23,1,"Misleading Listing, No Refund, Zero Accountability","I booked a property on Airbnb that advertised a jacuzzi and cowboy hot tub.

After booking, I discovered the jacuzzi was completely out of service, and the cowboy tub required an additional $60 fee — only mentioned at the bottom of the listing. This was not disclosed clearly or upfront.

When I tried to cancel, Airbnb only offered cancellation with no refund. I contacted the host less than 20 minutes after booking — they refused to cancel. Airbnb support agents also denied a refund, despite the obvious misrepresentation and their own policy about listing accuracy.

I formally informed both the host and Airbnb that I would not be checking in and have since filed complaints with multiple consumer protection agencies. I’ll be disputing the charge through my credit card.

Let me be clear:

I never received the service I paid for.

I did not purchase these credits as a long-term investment or savings tool.

I urgently needed this money to pay for alternative accommodation, which I had to book elsewhere.

So its like they dont want you to order any apartment.
And how is writing down card details the only way to verify yourself?
Looks like I personally need to order from the apartment owner instead of using frivolous Airbullshit."
2025-05-22,1,Just awful customer service.,I had the pleasure of talking to Airbnb customer service. They're American awful at it's best. Super friendly. Didn't listen to a word I said and kept calling me Ruujer. And in the end they only wasted 20 minutes of my life and achieved nothing.
2025-05-21,1,Not recommended as a platform to Host,"I've been as a Super Host for more than 5 years. Totally dissapointed with latest Customer Service.

2025-05-21,1,Misleading cancellation policy which costed me €920,"I've been using Airbnb for years and have always had great experiences—until my most recent booking.

The issue was with the cancellation policy. The listing clearly stated that I could cancel by a certain time and receive a full refund. I followed that instruction and canceled within the timeframe—or so I thought. To my surprise, I later discovered that my booking was canceled but not eligible for a refund. It turns out the cancellation deadline was based on Thai time, while I was in Portugal. This crucial detail wasn’t made clear during the booking or cancellation process.

As a result, I lost €920.

I reached out to both the host and Airbnb support. While they expressed understanding and sympathy, no one offered any practical solution to help recover even part of the loss. No refund, no way to reverse the cancellation, no compensation—nothing.

I'm very disappointed with Airbnb’s cancellation policies and the lack of a clear, reliable process to handle situations like this—especially when they result from misleading or incomplete information. Losing €920 due to a time zone mismatch and getting no support or alternative is incredibly frustrating."
2025-05-21,1,A Nightmare Experience with Airbnb – Broken Promises and Abysmal Support,"My recent experience with Airbnb has been nothing short of a nightmare, marked by unprofessional hosts, deceptive practices, and a complete lack of accountability from Airbnb’s support team. What was supposed to be a family holiday in London turned into a stressful ordeal that left us stranded, humiliated, and financially burdened.

Check-In Chaos and Misleading Listings
Upon arriving at our booked property in Canary Wharf, we waited outside for an hour with heavy luggage. The host’s representative, Vanessa, arrived late, forgot the keys, and later provided malfunctioning access to the building. When we finally entered, we discovered ongoing maintenance work—tools, workers’ belongings, and debris littered the living area and kitchen. This critical detail was never disclosed in the listing, despite the host’s later contradictory claims. When confronted, the host, Rossorio, became hostile, accused us of rudeness, and demanded we leave immediately.

Airbnb’s “Support” – Empty Promises and Gaslighting
Desperate for help, I contacted Airbnb support multiple times. While agents initially promised compensation (verbally agreeing to £75 for expenses and a partial refund), these commitments vanished in writing. Instead, I received generic responses citing “host policies” and a refusal to honor verbal assurances. Worse, when I tried rebooking, Airbnb flagged me as an “unauthorized party,” blocking new reservations without explanation.

Financial Loss and Betrayal
Despite agreeing to a £35 cancellation fee for an upcoming reservation, Airbnb deducted £65 without justification. The promised £75 compensation for our ordeal also never materialized. In total, I’m out £105 due to Airbnb’s mismanagement. Their final response? A cold, copy-pasted link to cancellation policies and a dismissive “case closed” message.

A Pattern of Negligence
Each support agent contradicted the last, forcing me to relive the trauma repeatedly. Commitments made over calls were denied in writing, exposing a systemic disregard for customer trust. Meanwhile, hosts like Rossorio face no consequences for blatant dishonesty, while guests bear the brunt of Airbnb’s lax oversight.

Final Advice: Avoid Airbnb
After this ordeal, I booked a hotel via Booking.com effortlessly. Airbnb, however, left my family stranded, stressed, and out of pocket. Their platform prioritizes hosts over guests, and their support team specializes in empty apologies, not solutions.

Proceed with caution – unless you enjoy false promises, financial disputes, and hours wasted arguing with unresponsive “support.” Airbnb has lost a customer for life."

2025-05-20,2,Hosts Beware,"Hosts, take note: Airbnb primarily views guests as their customers, not hosts. In many disputes, they tend to favor the traveler’s side—even when it comes to property damage or violations of house rules. Getting reimbursed for damages can be a frustrating, uphill process. Airbnb often issues partial refunds without your consent, and sometimes even full refunds within cancellation windows—regardless of circumstances. While the platform does a great job of getting your listing seen and booked, don’t expect a fair resolution when conflicts arise. As for retaliatory reviews? Unfortunately, contesting them is nearly always a losing battle."

2025-05-20,1,Disappointed: no support after same-day cancellation,"I've been a loyal Airbnb user for years and have always had great experiences — until now.

I booked a stay and had to cancel just 3 hours later. The check-in was still days away, no services were used. Despite this, the host refused a full refund and Airbnb simply said there was “nothing they could do.”

The platform hides behind policy and offers no protection to guests when a host chooses to be inflexible — even in clear, reasonable situations. I asked for a gesture of goodwill (like a credit), but even that was denied.

Unfortunately, this experience has shown me that as a guest, you're on your own when things go wrong. I've lost trust in Airbnb and won’t be booking through them again."

2025-05-19,2,Customer Service and Poor Website Redesign,"While Airbnb is a massive global platform, the quality of its customer service is surprisingly poor. It’s frustrating to see that a company valued at $84 billion has such a low average rating of 1.4 on Trustpilot—clearly, I’m not the only one who feels this way. The lack of responsive and helpful support is simply unacceptable.

Additionally, the recent website redesign is a step backward. The new layout is confusing, cumbersome, and far more complex than the previous version. If something works well, why change it? The new interface makes navigation unnecessarily difficult, which only adds to the frustration when trying to resolve issues.

For a company of this scale, I expected far better in both customer support and user experience. I hope Airbnb takes the feedback seriously and makes meaningful improvements."

2025-05-18,1,"Avoidable cancellation, loss of trip and non-refundable event tickets, horrendous customer service experience","Extremely disappointing experience with Airbnb.

I’ve been a loyal Airbnb customer for nearly a decade and have always had great experiences—until now. My recent booking for a weekend getaway was canceled due to what Airbnb claimed was a payment issue. The truth? My credit card had recently expired, and Airbnb made no effort to update the info, even though their own Terms of Service (2.4) say they can obtain updated details from my bank. No such attempt was made.

Worse, they only notified me via email—which landed in spam. No messages through the Airbnb app, no texts, no calls. For a time-sensitive issue like this, relying solely on email is outdated and irresponsible—especially when their app is the primary way they communicate for everything else.

I had a scheduled call with a case manager, which Airbnb completely mishandled. Instead of calling at the agreed 10:00 AM time, they tried to reach me at 1:00 AM (!), then closed my case when I didn’t answer. I had to spend a day and a half on the phone with multiple reps trying to sort it out—no resolution, just frustration.

Even more baffling: they had a working card on file that had been charged successfully just two days earlier for another booking, yet never attempted to use it.

In the end, the host—who had nothing to do with the issue—graciously issued a full refund, despite having to take a loss in profits for having to reduce the rental costs for a last minute booking.  Airbnb offered nothing. Because of their failure, three friends and I lost our accommodation, and $800 in nonrefundable event tickets. This was a trip we’d looked forward to all year, and I even took time off work for it. We missed it all.

Airbnb needs to review and update their policy regarding expired cards. This was a completely preventable situation. Airbnb dropped the ball at every step. I expected better.   "

However, it now appears that support has been outsourced to countries like India or Bangladesh. Unfortunately, the current representatives seem to lack the authority or knowledge to take meaningful action. They strictly adhere to scripted guidelines and often repeat the same responses, even after multiple disputes and the submission of clear circumstantial evidence.

Recently, a guest left a review accusing us of being scammers. When I raised this with support, I was told the comment was acceptable because it reflected the guest’s personal experience—completely disregarding the serious implications such a statement has on our integrity as hosts."

2) they are keeping those dates for their regulars

3) those dates may fall on a motorbike event and they want to review their prices for that week.

I don't understand the purpose of this air bnb site to make bookings if the air bnb owners can decline on the above grounds. Why bother advertising them dates and wasting people's time if they have no intentions on confirming those bookings or they want to hike the prices up to extorianate prices for specific dates.

Absolute waste of time using this system.

Even though I had proof of her actions, airbnb allowed her to cancel my listing and I was put out on the street. 
Airbnb then canceled my account!

2025-05-16,1,"Airbnb’s support system is manipulative, dishonest and legally dangerous. This is a warning.","We booked a long-term stay in Mallorca via Airbnb and ended up in a health-threatening disaster:

A 60-year-old house with black mold, damp walls, crumbling facades, and falsified listing photos – run by a so-called “Superhost” with 0 previous reviews.

On April 23, 2025, we reported the situation to the host after discovering severe mold, decaying walls, and structural water damage.

On May 6, 2025, we escalated the case to Airbnb – expecting protection, fairness, and transparency.

We sent Airbnb dozens of timestamped proof photos, showing the horrific state of the property and walls literally rotting from the inside out, covered in mold, moisture, and decay.

And yet, Airbnb kept believing the host’s absurd lies.

The host refused to acknowledge the severity of the situation.

He didn’t offer a refund, didn’t treat the damage as urgent, and had no alternative accommodation available.

We were dependent on having a safe place to stay – and were forced to remain in a property that was medically dangerous.

Airbnb was fully aware of this – and still chose to side with the host.

They told us: “You probably caused it.”
Really?

You expect us to believe that an entire property developed deep black mold, structural moisture damage, and collapsed plaster in less than 20 days – simply because we stayed there?

That’s not just nonsense – it’s insulting.

We were told by one Airbnb support agent that we could receive a 30% refund.

Then suddenly, a “Senior Escalations Manager” named Angel claimed that Airbnb’s policies only allow 10% maximum.

We asked for proof.

We asked for a clear clause in Airbnb’s terms.
They refused.

No documents. No links. No transparency.

Then suddenly… the number changed again.

We were offered €2,349.41 (≈30%) plus a €500 coupon, bringing the total “refund” to over 37%.

But here’s where it becomes ethically disgusting:

Airbnb told us we had 1 hour to accept the offer – or we would lose it forever.

One hour.

In the middle of a medically documented health crisis.

We refused the manipulation.

We responded calmly, with legal clarity, and insisted on our rights.

And their response?

❌ They shut down the chat
❌ They blocked us from replying
❌ And they “closed” the case – without a refund, without an agreement, and without accountability

We are now taking action via:

– Balearic Tourism Authority (Mallorca)
– Spanish Consumer Protection Agency (Consumo)
– Legal counsel, due to proven health risk and misrepresentation

Airbnb has ignored evidence, silenced the guest, protected a lying host, and used time pressure tactics instead of resolving the case properly.

To everyone reading this:
Do NOT trust Airbnb’s image.

Their customer service system is broken, opaque, and dangerously unethical when it truly matters.

Please share this review, repost it, and copy it to social media.

Let the world see how Airbnb treats guests in crisis – with denial, blame-shifting, and silence.

Case number: A48918488

We will not stop until this is resolved – properly, fairly, and publicly.

2025-05-16,1,Refuse to give my money back ,"Title:
Unfair Charge – No Help from Airbnb Support

Review:
I had a very frustrating experience with Airbnb. While browsing the app, I accidentally confirmed a reservation. I realized the mistake immediately and canceled the booking within seconds. Despite this, Airbnb refuses to refund me or offer a credit, even though I never used the service or caused any cost to the host.

What’s worse is that customer support has been completely unhelpful, giving me scripted responses and asking me to “wait 72 hours,” only to do nothing. I’ve spent days trying to resolve this and feel completely ignored.

This is unacceptable customer service and an unfair policy. A simple human error shouldn’t cost a customer hundreds of dollars. Be very careful using the Airbnb app — their cancellation policy is ruthlessly inflexible, even in obvious error cases.

I’ve filed a dispute with my bank and will think twice before ever booking with Airbnb again.

2025-05-15,2,No Airbnb reviews after 14 days," This  is a review of from a customer support perspective. I have been a customer of Airbnb for 12 years. I can say I have had mostly very good to great hosting and accommodation from this company. Recently we had two great  Airbnb experiences in Portugal and when I returned home I wanted to give them 5 star+ reviews. After further travel and catching up with business at home I sat down to write  reviews but was informed that I had passed a 14 day limit for reviews. I reviewed this policy and could find no good rationale or logic for it. I contacted customer support texted them and talked to them on the phone. The customer support center is obviously located as a call center probably in South Asia somewhere and the staff and senior advisors are handcuffed when it comes to this policy. They have no authority or discretion in making decisions. Obviously me writing a five star review would be good for the company, my Airbnb hosts and potential customers. Not going to happen-stonewalled with scripted responses. Wonder what would happen if we ran into some serious problems on the road."
2025-05-15,1,"Discrimination tolerated, support dismissive — deeply disappointed in Airbnb","I had a deeply disappointing experience with a host on Airbnb who made offensive and inappropriate assumptions about me based on my nationality (Ukrainian) and language.

After I answered a simple question slightly differently (but clearly), the host:
	•	Questioned my English skills, even though I’m fluent.
	•	Suggested I was using someone else’s account.
	•	Referenced my nationality in a suspicious way.
	•	Dug into my profile and emails to “verify” who I was.

I withdrew the booking because I no longer felt safe or respected. I reported the host to Airbnb, expecting a serious review — but instead, I received a generic response saying there was “no violation of the Nondiscrimination Policy.”

Despite sending screenshots and a clear explanation, my case was closed without action or follow-up. I requested escalation, but Airbnb ignored my messages completely.

Airbnb claims to stand for inclusion, but my experience proves otherwise. Discrimination is not always loud or obvious — sometimes it’s subtle, patronizing, and just as harmful. And Airbnb’s unwillingness to address it seriously is unacceptable.

I’ve lost trust in the platform’s ability to protect its users and uphold its values."
2025-05-15,1,Superhost? black mould and filth,"Renting with a Superhost brings no reassurances. The 'modern' property had black mould, green algae, broken doors and windows, and it was black filthy with dust, dirt and lots of human hair in the freezer, expired groceries, unwashed linens. 

Airbnb mediated my complaint and offered their maximum 30% refund, despite the property not being suitable for any guests. This isn't about star rating, it's about the property being unhygienic and unsafe with a back door accessible to the public that wouldn't lock. 

And the property listing? Mostly five star reviews. 

I will never book with Airbnb again. They don't care about their customers, only their hosts. There is nothing to hold hosts accountable for providing squalid conditions. "

So, forget the star rating at the beginning, introduce more categories with comments for verification and clarification.  Start with equipment, standard of furnishings and the like and we will start to see more honest and useful reviews and the overall  score will be more accurate.

2025-05-14,1,Avoid like the plague,"Airbnb has clearly shifted toward protecting hosts at all costs, even in cases involving false listings, safety issues, and broken promises. I provided clear proof of a misleading listing, shared security access, and a failed refund agreement, yet Airbnb's response was only to hide behind internal policies. If trust is truly a priority, then travelers deserve protection, not deflection. This experience has permanently damaged my confidence in the platform."
2025-05-13,3,Airbnb a double edge sword for the host,"After spending thousands of dollars on setting up an apartment we have in our home we listed it with Airbnb. After the first several days, we were getting consistent bookings until one day. We got a booking on dates that we had blocked out on the calendar on the Airbnb site, which caused a conflict and no matter how we communicated to the people that were seeking the reservation, we were unable to contact the people, whether it was a problem through Airbnb or the people ignoring the message.

The first time it was stated by the customer service on Airbnb that we had a switch turned on that allowed for automatic confirmation of bookings, which I explicitly had gone into the settings and turned off and when I explained it to them, they said that they wanted to go into the settings with me and turn it off while we were on the phone to be certain that it doesn’t occur again And that’s exactly what we did.

After receiving numerous notifications of confirmations that we had not made, we contacted the company again and they told us it was an internal error and that they would correct the situation however, it will eventually cause us to have very low ratings and not be able to rent our apartment through Airbnb and they took no interest in that part of my concern.

The next thing that I was trying to address was when I ask what country my call to Airbnb is being transferred to they flat out refuse, even though it’s very obvious that it is being routed through India, of which they refuse to admit that the call is going to India and they claim that they’re not allowed to tell us which is against the United States laws that they must tell The person who requests where the call is being routed by US law, but they continue to refuse.

I have found in my short time that Airbnb does not care about the people who host on their site. They care about getting their money from their cut of the reservations and they redirect our calls through India even though many times the people on the phone from India are very in polite and do not listen and they talk through you and refuse to answer questions. 

It is becoming very very evident that I must list my apartment, which is very very nicely furnished, and everyone is overly happy with our hospitality, and I must list it dozens of other places because Airbnb has fallen off. It’s reputation drastically in a short period of time. The owner must be a trillionaire , but he’s fallen asleep at the switch and just living on the royalties I imagine."

The listing said ""1 double bed, 1 air mattress, 1 floor mattress"". There was NO bed. It was futon with a futon mattress.. which is NOT a regular mattress. The photos looked NOTHING like the actual place. If we stayed the night I would have had an asthma attack it was NOT clean and comfortable. The listing said ""full bathroom"", but there was NO toilet. A ""bathroom"" BY LEGAL DEFINITION has toilet. We thought the port a potty was an ADDITIONAL potty for the ""tent"" they said anyone could bring for additional guests. ""Plenty of room to pitch a tent add 4+"". Their listing said ""THIS IS A GLAMPING EXPERIENCE in a TINY HOUSE."" 1) a tiny house has indoor plumbing! 2) The definition of ""glamping"" is a combination of ""glamourous and camping"".

2025-05-12,1,Airbnb has let us down.,"Airbnb has let us down.
We had a guest who requested the location two and a half hours before the check-in time. The employee, in a rush, sent the location of a nearby restaurant—but unfortunately, it was the wrong branch in a different area. However, the employee did provide the detailed address in the chat and was waiting for the guest, who requested early check-in.The issue didn’t end there. While the guest was still on the street, they wrote that the apartment was not clean and gave it a one-star rating. They then requested a refund and canceled the booking. Airbnb staff asked us to remove the review, stating that the guest’s claims were untrue. However, Airbnb’s management kept the review, stating that the apartment was not good, despite knowing the guest was on the street and never even entered the building. They allowed the review claiming the apartment was unclean to remain.Furthermore, they sent us a message saying they might suspend our apartment listing on the platform. I strongly advise listing your properties on another platform. I have all the messages to prove this."
2025-05-12,1,WOULD GIVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD! AIRBNB IS HEARTLESS!,"I had a medical emergency, a fractured foot, and provided all the proof, including doctor documentation. My booking was marked non-refundable, but I reached out in good faith hoping Airbnb or the host would show even the slightest bit of human decency. Instead? Stonewalling. No compassion. No flexibility.

Airbnb made it loud and clear: they don’t care about real people or real emergencies. Their policy is profit first, people last.

Let me be blunt: this company is a soulless machine, and their so-called ""support"" process is a joke. They hide behind policies while punishing guests who are already going through enough.

There are better alternatives out there with higher ratings and actual human support. I’ll never give Airbnb another dollar, and I’ll make sure everyone I know hears this story."
2025-05-11,1,This company is the absolute worst,"This company is the absolute worst. I booked a bachelor party home for $8,000. I had back surgery and needed to cancel. The host rebooked our weekend for the full amount, and Airbnb and the host STILL would not reimburse. This company is disgusting. I typically book very large homes for large groups. NEVER again will I use this awful company."
2025-05-11,1,"Airbnb rented me a house that was up for sale, disregarding my safety and comfor","I rented a house abroad for one year through Airbnb. A few days after moving in, I saw that the house had been put up for sale. Apparently, Airbnb rented me a house for a year that was actually up for sale. A few days later, the landlord messaged me to inform me that potential buyers would be coming to view the house. I told Airbnb that I was not happy with this situation and asked them to correct this mistake. People come to see the house 2-3 times a week. I have complained to Airbnb many times. Each time, I had to deal with a different customer representative, but every one of them closed the case without solving my problem. The customer representatives are very uninformed and indifferent. The company charges me a large amount of money every month, but does nothing for my comfort or safety, nor does it protect my rights. They have left me at the mercy of the landlord in a foreign country."

he never responded.  i contacted airbnb and they gave me 200, so i still lost some money.

i made another reservation which was not cancelable.  my girlfriend didn't like the place so i canceled.  the host (Dustin) was very slow to respond and kind of rude.  he states, that airbnb policy is........

what a bunch of crap.  you give someone $400 dollars for nothing, because of a policy..

airbnb is helping home owners commit theft.  there needs to be a much better cancelation policy.  

this home owner didn't do anything and gets 400 for a policy that protects the home owner and not the customer. 

i won't be using airbnb ever again....."
2025-05-10,1,Total thieves,"Hosted a guest who left a 5***** review. airbnb claimed they sent payment. Not true. 
I then received a message to say payments to me had been suspended as I needed to prove my ID by sending a copy of my passport. (I have been a Superhost for 8 years!!)
I reluctantly sent a copy of my passport and am still waiting for payment. 
This is totally illegal and tantamount to fraud. These scumbags even take a cut of the cleaning charge!! 
Happy to see the Italian govt have fined these a**holes more than €300 million for tax fraud. 
Parasites thru and thru! 

"
2025-05-10,1,USE THIS PLATFORM AT YOUR OWN RISK,"Extremely disappointed with Airbnb.
I vacated a property early due to multiple breaches of the listing description and completely unacceptable living conditions. I also notified the host of a medical emergency and a change in financial circumstances. Despite this, she attempted to charge me for the final payment weeks early-outside of Airbnb’s own strict refund policy.

I have requested a £1,165 refund for the unused stay from 8 May to 8 June 2025. Despite contacting Airbnb through all the proper channels, my case remains unresolved, and the lack of support has been incredibly frustrating.

I’m now sharing this publicly in hopes of finally being taken seriously. Guests deserve better protection and accountability when hosts fail to meet basic standards."
2025-05-10,1,"Travellers be warw, huge safety risk ","I had a shocking experience with an Airbnb stay in the UK where I was physically trapped inside the property not once, but twice due to a faulty front door latch. The host admitted this “sometimes happens” — which is terrifying. Imagine being unable to leave a building in an emergency.

I eventually received a refund, but Airbnb allowed the host to post a false and defamatory review, accusing me of intentionally locking myself in to avoid paying. This is not only absurd — it’s blatant victim-blaming. I requested Airbnb remove the review under their own policies (which prohibit false and retaliatory comments), but they’ve failed to act.

Worse still, the property is still listed — meaning other guests could be put at risk. Airbnb talks a big game about guest safety, but my experience shows how easily they let hosts get away with dangerous conditions and dishonest conduct, even when reported.

This experience has completely destroyed my trust in Airbnb. I expected a safe place to stay — not to be trapped and publicly defamed.
"
2025-05-10,1,Not there to help,"Especially as a super host, Airbnb boasts that they are always there to help. However, if you actually need their help or support they are useless. Read their own policies over and over again like you are an idiot and new at this. The policies that they create themselves and change every couple months. They act like they can't do anything and that nothing can be done when they can make any changes that they want to but choose not to. Airbnb cares about money, not about their guests or hosts. Hosts are held hostage by reviews. It is a garbage system. "

I had a phone call from a lady after I emailed the CEO of Airbnb but no cash in my bank as yet her phone number 01844 234 2500 but she has not got back to me.
My disagreement is you go into a shop buy something but can't get the item you've bought for 8 day's later.
Airbnb needs to address this to stop people losing out and waiting for their own cash. Reference number

I wrote to host and asked to for change so they send me a request for change but guess what, I couldn't accept again as my account was connected to old lost card. I spoke to them but they said they need in writing. so I wrote to them but they said they need in writing from host. then they said you need to make full payment but my payment wasn't due for another month?!

The fact that there is no continuity between one rep and the next makes the communication so difficult.  Instead of talking to the same person who can keep track of the situation, every time you send a message you get assigned a new person and they don't take the time to fully read and understand what is happening.
It has happened to me multiple times as a guest and I now do all I can to avoid booking on Airbnb when travelling."

2025-05-08,1,Discrimination Allowed—No Accountability,"Airbnb allowed a host to cancel our reservation after learning we were bringing an infant. Instead of holding the host accountable, they sided with them—despite clear anti-discrimination rules and federal Fair Housing protections for families with children. After we booked, the host retroactively added misleading language claiming the home wasn’t suitable for children (not having outlet covers… we visit the babies grandparents and they don’t have outlet covers! Our baby isn’t even mobile yet!!)—purely to justify the cancellation. Airbnb support acknowledged the reason was “infant not allowed” but still did nothing. No compensation. No accountability. Deeply unethical and unacceptable. The airbnb is listed as “Cozy Cottage! Champagne on a Beer Budget! Steps2Sand.” The host allows pets but would not allow an infant. "
2025-05-08,1,Airbnb Host,"I'm a superhost on Airbnb and they have without a doubt the worst customer service.
They are lazy, unhelpful, totally useless and don't seem to understand what the issues, problems are.
Absolutely terrible."
2025-05-08,1," I stayed for a month—money was stolen, and Airbnb won’t let me leave a review","My wife, baby, and I stayed at an Airbnb in Kuala Lumpur for a month. The host arranged for a cleaner to come weekly. We checked out on April 1, and while packing to leave the country, we discovered cash missing from three different wallets stored in separate places inside the apartment:
	•	My wallet (in my backpack in the living room) had foreign currencies I’d collected over years—worth ~$100.
	•	My wife’s wallet (hidden in her bag in the bedroom) had 200 euros, a gift from her sister after our baby was born.
	•	A change wallet, visible in the living room, had a $5 note with symbolic value.

We didn’t use these wallets during the trip—we relied on Apple Pay and credit cards—so we only realized the money was gone when we started packing.

No one had access to the unit except the host’s cleaner, who last visited on March 30. We contacted the host—no help. Airbnb support—no help. Then I filed a BBB complaint.

Airbnb responded to the BBB multiple times saying I was “working with a specialized support team,” but I had not received a single message. After I followed up again, I was finally contacted over a week later—only to be told to “be patient.”

The most frustrating part? Airbnb refuses to let me leave a review because their system only allows 14 days after checkout—even though the theft was only discovered after we left.

I’m not asking for a refund—just to share my experience honestly so others can protect themselves. But Airbnb is actively preventing me from doing even that."
2025-05-08,1,A complete Joke,"The support system of Airbnb has become a complete joke for hosts... They spam you almost daily to publish your experience, and when you do follow their exact steps, there is not publish button. I tried multiple times to request help from Airbnb support only to get calls from them in random hours, I'd pick up and they'd hang up, or they would respond in the chat with pretty much automatic responses with no regard to the problem. This has been very frustrating, delays and stalls my experience and most of all, wastes a lot of energy by having to focus on all this Airbnb nonsense... This company has become a complete joke."
2025-05-07,1,Cancelled ,Booked a place for one night in Sunderland. Host cancelled - no explanation given. What gets me is that I cannot leave a review to warn other potential users of this property. You can only do this if the host cancels within 24 hours of check in. Makes me very wary of using Airbnb if they are hiding valuable information like this. 
2025-05-07,1,"Misleading listing, no Gulf access – Airbnb protects host, not guestI booked a house on Airbnb that was…","I booked a house on Airbnb that was promoted as having “Gulf Access” in Cape Coral. This feature was central to my booking decision, as I had planned to rent a boat. Upon arrival, I found that the canal access had been blocked for months due to construction — something Airbnb and the host were informed about well in advance. This was never disclosed in the listing.

Despite clear evidence, Airbnb refused to offer fair compensation and merely issued a token refund of CHF 200. The host took no responsibility, and Airbnb chose to protect the host rather than the guest.

This was a classic case of misrepresentation by omission, and it turned my once-a-year holiday into a frustrating experience. I’ve filed a formal complaint through my credit card provider and will never use Airbnb again for travel."
2025-05-07,1,Prone to cancellations,"Prone to cancellations by hosts and, it turns out, when this happens, Airbnb penalises the host financially and keeps the money for themselves rather than pass it on to the person who’s been let down. Furthermore, when you make a complaint against a member of staff, that same staff member deals with the complaint themselves. Hardly a transparent process."
2025-05-07,1,As a host,"As a host, Airbnb has provided terrible customer service. They don't seem to understand what the topic is as they simply cannot answer simple questions. They keep on repeating lines that are irrelevant, even when multiple agents are involved.
Further, they try to call you in the middle of the night, even though when asked to chat with messages."
2025-05-06,1,🚨Airbnb Guests Abuse in Le Touquet…,"🚨Airbnb Guests Abuse in Le Touquet (North of France) – Our Family Was Left to Sleep in the Car 🚨

This Bank Holiday weekend, my partner, our two young children (5 & 8), and I were left stranded at night in northern France with no access to our Airbnb – despite informing the host of our late arrival.

We had booked a 3-night stay at Stella Plage (Le Touquet). Due to school pick-up, London traffic, and Eurotunnel delays, we arrived at 11:30pm instead of 10pm. The host, Rodolphe, had initially agreed to a late check-in and said the agency (Mélanie) would hand over the keys.

But when we arrived:
❌ Mélanie refused to give us the keys
❌ Rodolphe cancelled the booking on the spot
❌ They ignored our calls and messages
❌ Airbnb couldn’t find us alternative accommodation
❌ They suggested we find a hotel ourselves & offered 20% off the first night booking as a gesture of goodwill

We were stranded in the middle of nowhere with everything shut. 
After calling every possible hotel in the area, we managed to find a hotel 1 hour away. 
It was 3am by the time.
Our kids had to sleep in the car half of the night.
This is not just bad service – it’s inhumane.

📢 We demand:
1️⃣ Full refund of the Airbnb stay
2️⃣ Refund of our emergency hotel
3️⃣ Refund of the 2 extra nights we had to rebook
4️⃣ That Airbnb bans this host from the platform
5️⃣ A real emergency support system for families

Airbnb, this is a disgrace. No one should be treated like this, especially with kids.

🙏 Please share this. 

🚨 Clients Airbnb abandonnés au Touquet – Notre famille obligée de dormir dans la voiture 🚨

Ce week-end de pont, ma compagne, nos deux jeunes enfants (5 & 8 ans) et moi avons été laissés à l’abandon en pleine nuit dans le nord de la France, sans accès à notre Airbnb – alors même que nous avions prévenu l’hôte de notre arrivée tardive.
Nous avions réservé 3 nuits à Stella Plage (Le Touquet). En raison de la sortie d’école, des bouchons à Londres et de retards à l’Eurotunnel, nous sommes arrivés à 23h30 au lieu de 22h. L’hôte, Rodolphe, avait pourtant confirmé un check-in tardif et indiqué que l’agence (Mélanie) nous remettrait les clés.

Mais à notre arrivée : 
❌ Mélanie a refusé de nous donner les clés 
❌ Rodolphe a annulé la réservation sur-le-champ 
❌ Ils ont ignoré tous nos appels et messages 
❌ Airbnb n’a pas trouvé de logement alternatif 
❌ Ils nous ont dit de chercher un hôtel nous-mêmes & ont proposé 20% de remise sur la première nuit, en « geste commercial »

Nous étions bloqués au milieu de nulle part, tout était fermé. Après avoir appelé tous les hôtels possibles de la région, nous avons trouvé une chambre à plus d’une heure de route. Il était 3h du matin. Nos enfants ont dormi une partie de la nuit dans la voiture.
Ce n’est pas un simple mauvais service – c’est inhumain.

📢 Nous exigeons : 
1️⃣ Remboursement intégral de la réservation Airbnb 
2️⃣ Remboursement de la nuit d’hôtel d’urgence 
3️⃣ Remboursement des 2 nuits supplémentaires que nous avons dû réserver ailleurs 
4️⃣ L’interdiction de cet hôte sur la plateforme Airbnb 
5️⃣ Un vrai dispositif d’aide d’urgence pour les familles
Airbnb, c’est une honte. Personne ne mérite un tel traitement, encore moins avec des enfants.

Do you know that the terms and conditions never help you?
If you have an issue and is under the Airbnb cancellation policies, really not. Finally, depends on the host's decision. Is that Inese from Airbnb told me by phone. She denied informing in a written message. You paid you lose"
2025-05-06,1,Airbnb is Like Communism-Great in Theory,"I am staying at a disgusting Airbnb right now. I am afraid to leave a negative review when we leave because it is well known that hosts also review guests. If you leave a bad review you will get a bad review. The problem? You don't know you are getting a bad review and cannot defend yourself. 

There is only a short window of time to leave your review, so they know exactly who left it. There is no anonymity. 

We paid good money for a whole house with a fenced in yard to stay with our two dogs, which are better behaved than most kids these days, and this place is a dump. Despite contacting the host directly to confirm that the yard is completely fenced in and receiving a confirmation of that fact, as soon as we got here, before even getting in the house, our one dog went behind the garage and around it and freely walked out and took a three hour tour of Erie, PA, including a swim in the bay to chase the ducks and geese. 

The bay is several miles from the house and he crossed several busy streets. He could have been killed and could possibly have killed or injured people driving who would likely swerve to avoid hitting him and there's nothing funny about that.

(And, yes, we did check out the fence before letting him off lead. We couldn't get behind the garage to the other side and it looked to be closed off from our vantage point.)

The house is filled with furniture out of Goodwill. Actually the furniture at Goodwill is probably better. They listed minimum rules on the website and then there was a whole list on the fridge when we got here-including taking the garbage out and placing it on the curb the evening we arrived. No, not our garbage. There are holes in the ceilings and the walls that have been patched poorly. There is a big hole in the bedroom ceiling patched with bare plywood. 

I could go and on, but you get the point. Coffee included. The cheapest possible coffee maker and cheapest possible coffee with dollar store brand creamer. No name shampoo, etc., etc.

Never using Airbnb again and calling them when we get home."
2025-05-06,1,Worst customer service out there ,People you stay with are absolutely brilliant......... Just hope you never have to deal with customer service because they are so far beyond shit at helping I actually don't have words to describe. Real shame to be honest

2025-05-05,1,"Protects TIME WASTING hosts, no support to customers…","The first property I booked for my hen fell through less than 24 hours after booking it, which was not ideal BUT it still gave us plenty of notice to find something else suitable, and the host gave a valid explanation as to why the booking was cancelled.
My second airbnb host cancelled less than 24 hours before check in without explanation, when this trip has been booked for months. We were a group of 8 needing space, so unsurprisingly we subsequently couldn't rebook ANYTHING suitable so last minute. When trying to complain and write a review about the awful treatment we received to warn other users, Airbnb ""support"" were completely useless, did not help at all and protected the rubbish host.
I'm disappointed that I can't even write a bad review. I had a whole hen weekend of activities booked in bath so needed accommodation in the city and when she cancelled so last minute there was absolutely nothing else available to accommodate 8 people. We needed a space for house/board games to accommodate a pregnant member of the group so going out/hotel was not an option.
The host was allowed to cancel without explanation, and I cannot even warn other users against this. It put a huge downer on my hen weekend!!! Especially knowing that if it was us that had cancelled so last minute we would have had to pay a fee! And she just gets away with it.

I am so utterly disappointed.I have closed my account. No point of Airbnb offering to send a discount for future bookings when the trip has been and gone, and this whole experience caused so many tears and distress on a weekend that was SUPPOSED to be fun. 

I will never be booking through Airbnb again. My first and only experience was TERRIBLE.

-December 2024 – March 2025: Due to his Airbnb account being suspended, Mr. Perez entered into a lodger agreement with Maria for a long-term stay, paying rent monthly.
-March 2025: Despite previously leaving a 5-star review, Mr. Perez contacted Airbnb to claim back his November 2024 payment. He also submitted a edited video recorded in March 2025, falsely claiming it was from his November stay. Airbnb removed his original review and subsequently closed Maria’s account without reviewing provided evidence, including lodger agreements and bank statements.
-Harassment & Police Involvement: In February 2025, Mr. Perez requested Maria to forgo his February rent due to personal reasons, which she denied. Upon returning in March 2025, his behavior escalated to harassment, leading to police intervention and his removal from the property.
-Legal Action: 
1-Maria intends to pursue legal action against Airbnb for supporting Mr. Perez in staying for free in November 2024 and enabling his refund claim despite clear evidence of his rental payments and agreements.
2- will file case of discrimination against her , as her voice was not heard and this leds to further support the harasser.

2025-05-03,1,A Heartbreaking Experience with OYO…,"A Heartbreaking Experience with OYO Rooms & Airbnb – A Night No One Deserves

We had booked an OYO room on Stade Street, Kent (CT21 6DT, UK) a week in advance through Airbnb, trusting both brands to deliver a safe and reliable stay. What we experienced was the complete opposite – a night of stress, fear, and abandonment that no human being, especially a pregnant woman, should ever have to endure.

Due to traffic and unavoidable delays, we arrived late — around 1:30 AM — only to be told over the phone by someone claiming to be from OYO that we couldn't check in because the hotel only accepts check-ins until 11 PM. We were shocked. We were literally just around the corner, exhausted, and hoping for some rest — especially with my wife being 8 months pregnant.

Instead, we were told we had to pay an additional £50 to check in. Reluctantly, I agreed, just wanting to get my wife into a warm bed. But then, after holding the line for 20 minutes, they claimed they couldn't reach the reception — essentially admitting there was no one there. The £50 fee felt like nothing more than a tactic, with no real intention of helping us.

I even got out of the car and knocked at the hotel door, hoping someone might respond. No one did. My pregnant wife and I stood helpless on an empty street, in the dead of night, cold and alone.

Airbnb was no better. I called them, explained the situation, and they said they would reach out to OYO and get back to us within 30 minutes. No one called. I called again. Nothing. Two major companies that promise safety, comfort, and support failed us completely when we needed them most.

We waited outside for nearly two hours — in disbelief, in fear, and in utter emotional exhaustion.

What makes it worse is knowing that OYO's founder built his company after he once faced a similar experience, locked out of a hotel himself. That pain inspired him to build a brand that would never let anyone else go through that again. But last night, we went through the exact same pain. Only now, his brand – which started with heart – has become unrecognizable.

This was not just poor service. It was a failure of compassion, of duty, and of the very values these companies claim to represent.

We will never book with OYO again. And for the first time, we’re questioning our trust in Airbnb too. A place to sleep at night is a basic human need. And on this night, that need was cruelly denied."
2025-05-02,1,Airbnb broke a written promise after 10 years of loyalty,"I’ve been an Airbnb guest for over 10 years and have rented a room at 12900 Wedding Drive, Manor, TX for 365 consecutive nights, paying $800/month. During a stay in Mexico City (April 19–20, 2025), I had a poor experience. Airbnb support (Mike) resolved it by issuing a $35 refund and promising a 50% discount coupon for a future reservation — in writing.

Later, Airbnb refused to honor the coupon, claiming it was an error. I have a screenshot of the message. They closed the case and denied further support, despite clear written evidence.

As a loyal customer who has spent nearly $10,000 over the past year alone, this is incredibly disappointing. Airbnb made a written promise and broke it — this is unethical and unacceptable.

I’ve filed complaints with the BBB and the Texas Attorney General. If Airbnb fails to correct this, I will escalate to arbitration."
2025-05-02,1,Airbnb Sides with Guest Leaving False Retaliatory Review – Hosts Beware,"
I've been a host on Airbnb for over 5 years with consistently excellent reviews and a well-maintained property. Recently, a guest caused considerable damage to my caravan. I submitted a reimbursement request through Airbnb with photographic evidence provided by a professional third-party cleaning team.

In response, the guest left a false and retaliatory review, claiming I was rude, that the property was in poor condition, and that I fabricated the damage. None of these issues were mentioned during or immediately after the stay—only after the reimbursement request was submitted.

Despite providing Airbnb with clear message history disproving the guest’s claims, they refused to remove the review. Even more disappointing was the rude and abrupt attitude I received from Airbnb support staff on the phone. The senior case manager spoke to me with a ""couldn’t care less"" attitude and offered no valid reason for allowing the review to stand.

Airbnb’s Review Policy supposedly prohibits retaliatory or misleading reviews, but in reality, they do not protect their hosts—even when the evidence is clear.

Prospective hosts, be warned: Airbnb will not support you when a guest leaves a defamatory or retaliatory review. You're on your own.

Update 11th May

Due to my multiple complaints to AirBnB as they wouldn't explain how the guest's review met their policy guidelines in retaliatory content I submitted a subject access request to get to the bottom of it myself. Within a few hours of submitting this request AirBnB removed my listing.

I'm now letting through Vrbo and Direct Holiday Homes. Vrbo is 100 times better so I highly recommend any owners switching to Vrbo if you facing issues with AirBnB. Vrbo called me up and talked me through the whole set up of my listing on the phone and I have a dedicated contact I can email at Vrbo if I face any issues. Vrbo also lists your property on all of the Expedia group websites, amazing!"

2025-05-02,1,"£31,000 payment demand 10 months in advance and then dreadful support service! is Found the perfect for our holiday…","Found the perfect house for our holiday in Florida for Feb 2026. The booking was for 29 days at a cost of around £30,000. Upon booking the Airbnb system asked for full payment in advance. Yes that's £31,000 in full at least 10 months before the booking date! Of course I was happy to pay a material deposit of 50% but expected to pay the remaining 50% nearer the start date like every other booking I've made with Airbnb. I contacted Customer support who told me it was their policy to demand full payment if the booking is over 28days!!

So, I wondered where my £30,000 paid to Airbnb would reside for 10 months and why I should lose out on any interest that such an amount may earn during that 10 month period if it was not sat in Airbnb's bank! I challenged Customer Support again to provide an answers and this is what I got.....

Yes, from a nameless ""Senior"" Case Manager. The grammer is dreadful and the reply mostly makes no sense. I had no idea that Airbnb were so bad!! But unfortunately their Trustpilot rating of just 1.5 stars appears very accurate.

So, based on my experience, my advise to all would be Airbnb customers is if you can possible book your accommodation with a different, credible agent then do and stay clear of Airbnb!

Finally I'm not expecting a response from Airbnb on here. I'm afraid they simply do not care enough.

2025-05-02,1,refund promise refund promise broken – Airbnb leaves host stranded,"I’ve been a reliable and well-rated Airbnb host for years. On Easter Sunday, a guest asked to check in much earlier than allowed. I clearly confirmed the regular check-in time (3pm) via Airbnb messages.

Despite this, the guest canceled. Shortly afterward, an Airbnb support agent called me directly and told me I’d receive a full payout if I agreed not to rebook the apartment for that period. I agreed – and I kept the place blocked.

Now, weeks later, I’m told I won’t be paid because I was “unreachable.”
That is simply untrue. I responded via Airbnb AND WhatsApp. I have full proof of communication.

I’ve requested escalation to a case manager or supervisor multiple times – no response, just generic replies.

This is a breach of trust and a broken verbal agreement from Airbnb’s side.
As a host, I feel abandoned and misled – despite having done everything right.

I hope Airbnb will take responsibility and provide a resolution. If not, I will escalate this case further – legally and publicly.

If anyone has had similar experiences with Airbnb, feel free to reach out. I’m open to exchange and potential collective action."
2025-05-02,1,Awful Customer Support – Completely Unreliable in Critical Situations,"I’ve had two deeply disappointing and unacceptable experiences with Airbnb’s customer support that have completely destroyed my trust in the platform.

The first situation occurred during a trip to Morocco. The listing I had booked turned out to be a nightmare — there was no Wi-Fi as advertised, ongoing noisy reconstruction work, and the place was extremely dirty. I couldn’t stay there, so I contacted Airbnb support expecting help. Instead, I was passed from one representative to another in endless back-to-back calls that lasted the entire day. They kept “looking into it” but never actually did anything. I was left without a place to stay in the middle of the night. No emergency listing. No help. Just exhaustion, stress, and frustration. This alone was enough to make me question the reliability of the platform.

The second experience was even more disturbing. I recently reported a host who replied to guest reviews with racist comments — a clear violation of Airbnb’s policies. In addition, I experienced serious health issues and even personal attacks during my stay, all of which I documented in detail and submitted to Airbnb. Despite this, they didn’t take any action for two days. Their only response was to repeatedly ask me vague questions like “How can we assist you?” even though I had already provided detailed context and documentation. They have access to the full chat history, know exactly what happened, and yet chose to delay and ignore rather than act.

Airbnb clearly has the tools and data to respond quickly, but instead chooses to stall and deflect. This isn’t just poor customer service — it’s outright negligence, especially when guest safety and well-being are at stake.

I will never use Airbnb again. There are alternative platforms out there with responsive and responsible support teams. If you’re tempted by slightly cheaper listings, remember that you’re also gambling with your safety and peace of mind. For me, it’s simply not worth the risk.
"
2025-05-02,1,My friend and I booked a property in…,"My friend and I booked a property in Morocco through Airbnb for seven nights. On the fourth night, after inviting guests over, we were harassed and threatened by individuals claiming to be related to high-ranking authorities. They demanded we remove our guests due to the proximity of a mosque. When we refused, we were warned of serious consequences.

Fearing for our safety, we were forced to leave the property the following morning. Despite reporting the incident to Airbnb and requesting a refund for the remaining nights, our request was denied — and my account was unfairly suspended without clear explanation.

We were the ones placed in a threatening and unsafe situation, yet Airbnb offered no real support or protection. This was a deeply distressing experience, and I expected better from a platform that claims to prioritize guest safety."
2025-05-02,3,Airbnb lets host down,"we have hosted on airbnb for almost 9 years and have 4.95, superhost rating. Yet a guest recently claimed the accommodation was ""unacceptable"" supported by photos of hard water stains in the kettle and shower. This enabled them to escape their 1 week booking commitment and get full refund - and at 8.30pm they clearly had alternative (probably with family) accommodation ready. Airbnb's handling was aggressive, citing that there would be ""consequences"" if we didnt refund despite years of delighted guests."

2025-05-01,1,Airbnb Sided With a Host Who Submitted Fraudulent Evidence – Serious Security Risk,"Me and my wife booked a place downtown through Airbnb that looked fine in the pictures. The host was responsive, but when we arrived, we were shocked by the condition: dust all over appliances, food stains embedded into furniture, and even leftover food on the countertops. We paid a cleaning fee, yet the host suggested sending a cleaner during our stay, which we refused—why should we be inconvenienced for a mistake that should never have happened?

We took photos and left a fair 4-star review (despite the condition) because the host was new to Airbnb. In return, we were accused of extortion—the host submitted doctored, fraudulent evidence claiming we demanded money to delete our review. This was completely false. We had zero communication with the host outside of Airbnb, and we have full proof of this.

Airbnb accepted the fraudulent evidence without verifying it. Even worse, they confirmed the alleged conversation happened outside their platform, raising a terrifying question: How did the host get our private phone number? Airbnb is supposed to protect guest information, yet our number was clearly accessed, spoofed, or worse—used to fabricate a false narrative against us.

Despite our repeated attempts to provide evidence disproving the host’s claims, Airbnb refused to help and took the host’s side. They dismissed our concerns, ignored the potential identity theft, and essentially allowed a host to get away with criminal activity.

This is not just about a bad stay—this is about Airbnb enabling fraud, negligence, and security violations. If a host can forge evidence and Airbnb doesn’t have the tools or willingness to detect that, EVERY guest is at risk.

The host’s name: Sk Ali. Be warned—there may be more like him. Airbnb clearly does not do forensic verification of screenshots or claims, and they clearly don’t have a proper security or fraud investigation team.

Airbnb is failing to protect its guests. If you've been affected by a similar situation, speak up. This platform is not safe."
2025-05-01,2,No common sense to be found here.,"I'm hosting my place here and I always doing my best to make my guest feel welcome at my place. But some guests are just terrible people. I had one women staying at my place a week ago. She acted friendly and cheerful during the stay, which is one night. But when she left my place all of a sudden left 2 star review. And complained about things that was clearly described in listing description and clearly visible on all photos. She knew what she is booking and her complaints makes no sense. But Airbnb refuses to remove her review only because she wrapped it up in nice words with 2* rating. This people have no common sense. I'm considering to remove my listing from here."
2025-05-01,3,Good Stay,"Good Stay, But Airbnb’s Platform Could Improve
I booked a weekend stay in a downtown apartment through Airbnb in April 2025. The place was clean and matched the description, and the host was friendly enough, responding to my check-in questions within a few hours. However, the booking process was frustrating—the app glitched when I tried to confirm my dates, and I had to contact Airbnb support to fix it. Their customer service was polite but took two days to resolve the issue, which was stressful so close to my trip. The stay itself was fine, but Airbnb needs to make their platform more reliable and responsive."
2025-04-30,1,They don't want to give refunds.,"I've booked a place, got the reply from the host that they cancel due to the price mistake made by Airbnb. Customer service didn't want to send a refund to my bank account, instead they insisted on Airbnb credit, added 22 euros as an ""extra refund"" but when I kept demanding a full refund to my bank account, customer service person offered me an extra voucher for 400 euros and help on finding a replacement for the canceled booking.

I had to find my own replacement because the guy kept sending me wrong options, but he never finished the rebooking.

Customer service stopped responding on my messages, so I called them. I had to talk to 3 different people, who were saying different thing but none of them helped me.

They were doing everything not to help me.

I have wasted 4 hours of my time and the issue is still unsolved. 
It is one of the worst experiences I've had with any kind of serviced in my life. Absolutely not worth your time and money!"

If it weren't for the necessity of the extra income, I would not deal with this hassle. Most of my guest really are great! Then I get those that want Michelin quality on soup kitchen price. I live in my home and rent a room (rented both spare rooms for over a year with minimal issues). But lately, they are not host supportive. Guest lie about the space and they take the guest word even when they contradict themselves! No one reads the listing, show up and make demands of things I have no control over or complain of things listed in the description. They put on a happy 'I love the place face' and then tear the place down with the review.  It's only to get a discount or free stay--they know the key words to use for this when they talk to the site. As a guest, I have traveled a few places and  only once did I have an issue, took photos of dirt, bugs and even had the agent on the site agree they mislead where the location was. But that time, they took the hosts side! There is no rhyme or reason."

During a recent trip, I had to leave my Airbnb early because of a serious safety concern — I returned to the rental to find the front door unlocked and all the lights on, even though I had secured everything before leaving. I immediately contacted the host and Airbnb, followed all the right steps, and ended up relocating to a hotel at my own expense.

Even though I provided tons of documentation (hotel confirmations, messages, everything they asked for), Airbnb ultimately refused to help reimburse me — even though I had to completely drain my hotel points to rebook safely and quickly. Their final response basically boiled down to: “Sorry, we can’t help you because you used points.”

It’s really disappointing to realize that even when you prioritize your safety and do everything you’re supposed to do, Airbnb doesn’t truly stand behind their guests. This experience made me rethink how much I can trust Airbnb when something actually goes wrong.

Just sharing for anyone else who thinks guest protection is guaranteed — unfortunately, that wasn’t my experience."

They tell me a specialized team is working on it and they will get back to me in 24 hours. They tell me this 3 days in a row. Yesterday I call and they said oh it's escalated, again for the fourth time, and someone will get back to me by the end of the day. Nobody called. Now I can't even send messages to the help center. It's blocked or just goes to nowhere and deletes. When I try to call I get left on eternal hold. So Airbnb has blackballed and ghosted me and suspended my account for unknown reasons. This is New York State they are operating in. The law here says I must receive details about the witness and the witness statement. I will take them to court. If you're reading this Airbnb, I don't just talk. I make moves. I will take you to court if you do not provide me with the witness statement that you are legally obligated to provide me with in the state of New York. You think you want to ban my account for unknown reasons 2 weeks before one of the busiest travel holidays in America? When I had options and I could have built my reputation with over 150 stays somewhere else? This is why people can't stand corporate America. You put your heart and soul into a business relationship with these fools, and they crap on you and treat you like trash. Corporate America you can kick rocks. I do not need you to make a living.

This almost always happens after their few days of stay, so they end up having free accommodation in central London. Airbnb continues to send their pre-set automated template responses, taking off my payouts as they like, allowing guests to cause damages to my properties without compensating as per their 'Host protection' policies. Then further allowing guests to post discriminatory, defamatory and retaliatory reviews. Any attempt to prove your case ends with automated, pre set response, refusing to remove the reviews which clearly violate their policies.

2025-04-27,1,"Airbnb Failed to Provide Safety, Support After Traumatic Burglary — Now Silencing Guest Reviews","We had an incredibly traumatic experience staying at an Airbnb property (House: Corteza Miel, in Cabo Velas, Costa Rica - Host: Rosario). While we were asleep, burglars broke into all four bedrooms and stole over $21,000 worth of valuables, including phones, jewelry, laptops, and cash. Despite the listing claiming a secure, high-end home with gated access and surveillance, security was nonexistent: the side gate was broken, the alarm system was never shown to us, and cameras only covered the front entrance.

After reporting the crime, Airbnb’s response was appalling. We were given no meaningful support, no help processing the ""AirCover"" insurance, and no resolution after hours of calls with untrained agents. To make matters worse, when I posted a review warning future guests, Airbnb allowed the host’s defamatory response to stay. Even after I complained, Airbnb refused to remove it. Eventually, they removed both my review and the host’s response, erasing the incident entirely.

Airbnb failed to protect us, failed to provide any real support, and failed to uphold their own policies — while silencing safety warnings for future guests. This is not just poor service, it’s negligence and dangerous for anyone staying with them.

2025-04-26,1,Unfair review policy and refusal to remove false guest feedback,"I had a guest who booked a private room in my apartment (clearly stated as ""room in a shared apartment"" in the listing). After their stay, they left a 1-star review saying they were “shocked” that other people live in the apartment — even though it was obvious from the listing, filters, and booking confirmation that it was not an entire place.

I contacted Airbnb support, provided all evidence, and explained that this was not about the quality of the accommodation but simply the guest’s own mistake and misunderstanding of what they booked.

However, Airbnb refused to remove the review, claiming it reflects “the guest’s experience.” But how can a guest’s misunderstanding of the booking type justify damaging a host’s reputation? This is not a matter of “experience” — this is a clear example of false and misleading feedback.

As a host, I feel completely unprotected from unfair reviews caused by guests who don’t read the listing properly. Airbnb’s review policy allows for abuse and damages honest hosts without any real recourse.

hosted by: 
Stefan Breen and Christina Breen. 

I want to warn others before they make the same mistake I did. I booked this Airbnb expecting a decent stay and at least honest communication — I got neither.

The host initially agreed to refund me after I decided not to go through with the stay. We had a conversation, and they assured me the refund would be processed once I cancelled. Based on that trust, I cancelled the booking.

But when Airbnb followed up with the host to process the refund, they completely changed their tune and suddenly decided to stick to their cancellation policy, refusing to give me back a single cent. So basically, I was lied to, manipulated into cancelling, and then they pocketed the money anyway. Dishonest, unprofessional, and completely unethical.

If you’re thinking about booking this place — don’t. I wouldn’t trust this host with anything, let alone your holiday plans or your hard-earned money. This experience has been a complete nightmare, and it’s shameful behaviour on the part of both the host and how Airbnb allows this kind of thing to happen.

Their option to defray the cost by $167 was declined, I decided to book hotel. 
They agreed to refund the deposit t the original payment method.
Today, I find they have recharged me the original deposit again.
I called and presented them with snapshot of credit card statement to show their error. Not surprisingly, they were clueless and could not figure out what happened and that they now actually owed me twice as much!!!

2025-04-25,1,We have been part of the Airbnb…,"We have been part of the Airbnb community as host for over nine years, and this is the first time I've had to have a look at trust pilot to see what other people are experiencing.
I can only say that this organisation lacks clarity, ownership and professionalism. When you call it, it's like talking to a robot, and I'm sure they read from a script.
Sadly, on this occasion, we have had damage to our property,
They say they are dealing with the situation, and for the past week we have received emails around midnight UK time from somebody who calls themselves Donald S. no name no job description, for all we know it could be a scam
They request evidence in video format to back up our claim, and we respond effectively
Initially, they say they cannot process videos longer than 30 seconds
So you shorten the video and send it in as per request
Next day around midnight, Donald S who previously requested you to send a video of 30 seconds, then get back to you with a comment "" we cannot access third-party videos'
No explanation, no apology for previous lack of clarity or professionalism 
No further information concerning who they are and what is their job description
Just another midnight oil Email request requesting the video in a different format
This has now gone on for a week, and I still have no outcome as to the extensive damage that has been dealt to my property
But seemingly, we have the Airbnb host guarantee
This company is shoddy, unprofessional, and process driven.
It seems they care more about the person who did the damage, than the client who's making them money.
However, we are left to pick up the pieces of the damage whilst the one who caused the damage is able to post a defamatory feedback on our profile that is based on lies and anger
So this morning, I decided to call up and talk to somebody who may be able to help me with the situation
Would you believe, you cannot talk to a manager?
They only respond by email
No accountability
No manager available
Just someone on the end of the phone who keeps saying no no no
Abysmal customer service
Airbnb, you should be ashamed
I have placed my 2.5 million property in your hands, and this is how you treat us
Reader beware of placing your valuable home in their hands"
2025-04-24,1,AirBnB Aircover  not worth the paper it’s written on,"I am a host on AirBnB. Over the Easter weekend Airbnb placed guests in my property who held an all-night party with drugs and kept the entire neighbourhood awake.  These guests smashed our home and did £2.5k worth of damage.  The police were involved.  The guest who booked our home had already received a review for similar behaviour from another host but yet was deemed by AirBnB as being of suitable calibre to book again with another host.

When I tried to claim the costs of damages from Airbnb’s AirCover scheme they made it as difficult as possible - asking for receipts of kitchen equipment that was installed 10 years ago, asking me to explain how the damage was done (when the guests were consuming drugs and I wasn’t there) and informing me they would not cover the cost replacing the locks after the guests took the house keys.  It seemed their safety policy allows guests like this to retain keys to properties that they have taken drugs at and trashed, which in my view represents a huge safety issue. 

I appreciate that incidents do occur and that they are often unexpected.  But how they are recovered is also important.  In this situation I felt completely abandoned by AirBnB.  They were more interested in wrapping layers or bureaucracy around the process, providing non genuine statements of support and in closing down the case regardless of whether it was resolved or not.

Their behaviour has been appalling and has confirmed to me that they really do not care about either hosts or guests.

If you have a rental property, think carefully about whether you want Airbnb to be your broker.  Because they are exactly that - just a broker.  If anything goes wrong you’ll be completely on your own. They do not care."

2025-04-24,1,Be warned: Airbnb removes negative reviews about properties!,"I recently booked a stay at an Airbnb, the property was not at all as described and our time there was fairly unpleasant. The host offered a 50% refund, but never delivered this. I left a fair, but accurate review and the host had this removed. When I contacted Airbnb support they did nothing to help - they wouldn’t enforce the refund or reinstate the review. I certainly won’t be trusting Airbnb to book accommodation again!"

Strange that planned maintenance is done over the May bank holiday. Now I understand why so many people say don’t trust AirBNB. 

Specifically don’t trust any booking you make with Prymeo as the host (Tijay).

I am pretty certain that they canceled my booking because they got more money from elsewhere. I will still be visiting Brighton that weekend so I will pass by and see if maintenance is really going on. "

They cancelled the reservation because my son didn't verify the call/res not sure.  I paid for the room and it was my account.  They kept pulling up an old account and telling me they understand my concern as a mother.  They rebooked it within 24 hours and then charged me an extra $55.00 dollars. Took months to get the money back thu my credit card company. I paid with my PAYPAL account and they were useless.  The room itself was fine."
2025-04-23,1,Their customer service is useless…,"Their customer service is complete useless. I just need to change a picture in my profile and they won't allow it, but they keep giving excuses.

It doesn't make any sense that these guys run their company so badly"

Completely false. Then not to mention the countless reports which yes happened me are true reporting camera the owners put in house . Complete bill the staff do not care at all if it come down to it bout customer just there money.
2025-04-22,1,AIRBNB has the worse host service,"AIRBNB has the worse service for their hosts. 
Fake and false information is allowed to be spread, as long as it is written by their guests. They treat the hosts like crap, and see them only as a vehicle to make even more money. They treat their guests perfectly. It is time to move on to another platform, where hosts are treated equally well as guests.  
"
2025-04-22,3,I Airbnb ignores my discrimination report against a host ,"
I submitted an official complaint to Airbnb about a host named Scott who made discriminatory, offensive, and humiliating comments toward me. He refused to rent his property to me solely because I speak Russian. He questioned whether I truly live in the U.S., even though I have been living here for 7 years and my identity is fully verified on Airbnb.

Worse, he mocked the way I spelled my own name and added a sarcastic “ha-ha” — clearly ridiculing and disrespecting me in the conversation.

I attached screenshots and submitted the complaint through Airbnb’s official channels. Days have passed, and I still haven’t received any response. Complete silence.

I expected Airbnb to take discrimination and xenophobia seriously, but it seems like they’re turning a blind eye. For a platform that claims to be built on inclusivity, safety, and trust, this is deeply disappointing.

No follow-up. No apology. No accountability. I’m extremely disappointed and feel unsupported as a long-time Airbnb user. I hope someone from Airbnb actually pays attention to this review.

2025-04-21,1,Worse they stole our money,"Very slow booking, hardly to get demand for your property"
2025-04-21,1,"Airbnb left my unstable host on the platform — unsafe for guests, and deeply unfair to her","About two weeks ago, I had a disturbing experience with an Airbnb host in France. She was elderly, clearly unwell — emotionally and mentally — and completely overwhelmed. Her communication was erratic, and her behavior became unpredictable. I trusted my instincts and left early, for my own safety.

But what shocked me most? Airbnb did nothing.

I reported everything in detail. They treated it like a standard support case, closed it quietly, and left her listing live. No follow-up. No accountability.

Yes, I was the guest at risk. But this is about more than one booking.

This woman should not be hosting strangers. She’s struggling — and continuing to host puts everyone in danger: the guests, but also her. She could be manipulated, harmed, or trigger a serious incident. Airbnb’s inaction isn’t just careless — it’s irresponsible.

Airbnb talks a lot about “trust and safety,” but where’s the empathy?
Not just for travelers — but for hosts who clearly need support, not five-star pressure.

This isn’t a rant. It’s a wake-up call.

Safety isn’t just about locks and listings. Sometimes, the most compassionate — and most responsible — thing a platform can do is say: This host needs care, not a new guest.

(And yes, I tried to post this in r/Airbnb. I got banned. Maybe that says something too.)"
2025-04-21,1,Airbnb cannot be trusted,"Airbnb cannot be trusted. They remove negative reviews from customers, falsely showing properties as only positively rated, and thus misleading and scamming the users!"
2025-04-21,1,Airbnb stranded me in a fake listing…,"Airbnb stranded me in a fake listing…
Airbnb stranded me in a fake listing and refuses to take accountability.

I was sold a listing in Lakeview, Chicago, but ended up miles away in North Center. The dishwasher didn’t work, the dishes were dirty, with hardly and mismatched silverware, and I’ve been stuck 10 days without a key to the building — unable to enter without relying on the host. Loud, daily thumping noises made it nearly impossible to work or rest.

Airbnb’s “Aircover” failed me. They offered no real relocation help and now threaten to withhold refund eligibility because I “chose to stay” — as if I had other options while traveling with dogs and belongings, and no replacement was provided.

Despite a BBB complaint, photos, and proof that the listing remains falsely advertised, Airbnb continues to downplay the severity and shift the blame. Even on Easter Sunday, they sent messages attempting to limit refunds and close the case — rather than resolve it.

I’m putting this out publicly because no one should be stranded or gaslit like this by a global platform. Consumers deserve transparency, safety, and accountability — not threats and neglect.

2025-04-20,1,last-MINUTE-canceled by host,"This is a review towards AirBnbs customerservice and their guest-HOSTILE-policies/guidelines. 
My last experience with AirBnb briefly summarized:
* When guests last-minute-cancels/no show, they lose all their money.
* When host last-minute-cancels without prior notice, they get a strike and a small penalty-fee. The guests bear all the additional expenses related to the cancellation by their host. 

Longer version:
Unfortunately my last booking got cancelled at last minute by my host, that happend when I've already arrived at their destination/doorstep. I informed them about my arrival, and the only response I received from the host right before the cancellation, was their short apology and that they ""THOUGHT"" they have informed me the day before about the cancellation.
This was by far the most disgusting behaviour I have ever faced, absolutely lack of respect of others. Iam shocked how AirBnb allows such trash of a human being able to operate on their platform. Due to the cancellation, I was also unable to leave a ""HONEST"" review of this host. (This again makes me suspicious if many of the reviews on AirBnB truly are inflated, as it seems negativity are mostly being avoided.)

Took some time to finally reach customerservice and i did express the frustration about the whole situation. Customerservice agents kept responding with automated generated nonsense about how ""sorry"" they were for my inconvenience, a full refund being issued, host getting a strike/penalty, etc. They also insisted on phone-calls, but I demanded all dialogue to be in written form just for the sake of documentation.
After 7-8 hours of contact and threats of reporting AirBnb, they eventuelly gave in with an additional 50% compensation on top of the full refund. But in exchange I wasted one full day of my vacation. 

With all that being said, 95% of my experiences on AirBnb has been positive. Most of the people I've met are truly honest, kind and hard-working. 

Sadly, I'll refrain myself using this platform until they provide customer-protection against hosts who last-minute-cancels WITHOUT assisting guest in search for alternatives. I dont want to gamble with my holidays like this, lessons learned this time. "
2025-04-20,1,Terrible experience,"Terrible experience. While traveling in Spain and booking Airbnb in Malaga, I encountered the problem with a host scam who responded my messages about late check in, and then in 15 min he stopped responding and I was left literally on the street. I contacted Airbnb support and instead of helping me with relocation, they said that I had to book a hotel myself (which was insanely pricy) and they would reimburse me only 30% of it. It wasn’t a logical solution at all and they literally refused to help and left the client on the street at night. 
When I contacted them with a demand to remove that scam property from the listing, so other customers won’t get into troubles, they did nothing, there wasn’t any single reply from them. "

2025-04-19,1,A waste of time and contradictory. ,"I contacted “Manon” for accommodation in Montpellier. My request was rejected. The organisation “preferred”, she said, people with reviews. (Having only started using Airbnb recently and not yet stayed at any of its establishments, I have no reviews.) I was thanked, incorrectly and presumptuously, for my “understanding”. Whereas I can sympathise, such a blanket and judgemental stance is unacceptable, and when it is found out, it ought to be called out. I called AirBNB as I had a message to say a “Refund” MAY be on its way. I raised the issue of money being taken from my account when the Host never intended to take my booking in the first place – ‘false pretence’ in my book – and asked what steps could be taken to ensure others wouldn’t be subjected to the same experience. I suggested that those who did not want to receive bookings from people without reviews should have it written on their profile, saving people from wasting time and expense. The Call Handler was simply disinterested – nothing would be done. I asked to speak to the supervisor and was told one would call “within 40 minutes”; no call was ever received. If Airbnb Call Handlers make it up as they go along – lie in other people’s terms – how can we trust those who provide accommodation to do any better? I will sign out of Airbnb once I have enjoyed my stay with kinder hosts than “Manon” appears to be, once and for all. NB: I received an email stating that no money was ever taken from my account, which contradicts previous emails from Airbnb."
2025-04-19,1,Disappointed and concerned.,"Disappointed and concerned.

After years of being a loyal @Airbnb guest, we encountered a serious health and safety issue at a property. We followed every procedure: reported the issue in real time, provided documentation, and tried to resolve it directly and through Airbnb.

What did we get in return?
Copy-paste replies. No real investigation. No accountability.

Airbnb’s so-called AirCover sounds great in theory, but when we actually needed it, it was just a buzzword.

This isn’t about compensation. We didn’t even ask for anything extra — just a refund for nights we physically could not stay at the apartment due to a legitimate health risk.

We’re not sharing this to complain. We’re sharing this to warn others:
When something goes wrong, you may find out how little protection you really have.

@AirbnbHelp – we expected better.

2025-04-19,1,"Failure to deal with simple issue, fobbed off with no complaints department","I am a host and have been trying now for nearly 8 weeks to get the description of my property changed to accurately reflect that it is in a national park, after Airbnb inserted incorrect information without any discussion with me. It seems there is an error in the technical department, but I keep getting fobbed off time and time again. Apparently, there is no complaints department so it is impossible to complain, and even though people are messaging me, it is with the same platitudinous commentary that I’ve been getting for 7 weeks now without any resolution. Extraordinarily frustrating and certainly not a positive experience as a host."
2025-04-19,1,Airbnb Promised a Refund - On a Recorded Line - Then Changed Their Mind,"I’m extremely disappointed with how Airbnb handled my recent experience. I booked a property in New Orleans back in January for a late April stay. At the time of booking, the listing had no reviews, but the host had solid reviews on other properties, so I trusted it.

In February, a new review appeared saying the apartment was dirty and UNSAFE. I also noticed that the listing was misleading, claiming the location was within walking distance to bars and restaurants—but the times listed were clearly for driving. I tried reaching out to the host to express my concerns, but never received a response.

The host’s cancellation policy only allowed a 50% refund, but given the new review and misleading description, I contacted Airbnb directly to request a full refund.

Over the course of several days, I had 13 separate phone calls with Airbnb support, spending over 2 hours explaining the situation repeatedly because no one seemed to read the case history. It was frustrating, but I kept following the process in good faith.

Finally, on Thursday, April 17th at 18:46, an Airbnb representative told me—on a recorded call—that I would be receiving a full refund, and even offered to help me rebook a new place. Based on that, I booked another Airbnb later that same night.

Then, at 1:23AM on Saturday, while I was asleep, I received a message from Airbnb saying I would not be getting a full refund after all!!! 

This kind of inconsistency and lack of accountability from customer support is absolutely unacceptable. I followed every step, trusted Airbnb’s word, and acted in good faith—and now they have gone back on their word and I’m stuck paying for it! 

Airbnb has lost my trust, and I strongly urge others to think twice before booking. If anything goes wrong, don’t expect their support team to back you up—even when they promise to."

We had a problem. Reported to host in the morning . His reply. Check out and I’ll refund.  … but I don’t expect a bad review  🙄🙄🙄🙄 …. That’s bribery 

So we sourced another accommodation for that night. ( no problems with this one at all)

Checked out, the refund arrived. Only 50% of what we were expecting. Asked why. Host called me a bully as I said I would report on it. Airbnb finally refunded after sending the chat log

When I wrote a truthful review. The just got it pulled down saying it was coercive. I had warned people to take ear plugs as the noise at might was unbearable from the traffic that seemed to use the road as a racetrack. 

I appealed and after 2 days of messaging Airbnb would not reinstate it

So after over 15 years and dozens of reservations I appear as a member for just 2 years with no reservations. They don't allow blending accounts. And it has been impossible to acces either account and to give the excellent evaluation my last host deserved. They make you go through some idiotic games to 'identify' yourself.

Such a disorganised company, and in the meantime they kept pushing me to cancel that apartment through my account so the host can put it back on the website for new guests! I can’t believe they allow a filthy place like that to carry on staying on the website without making any changes. We left the next day of arrival and had to get another place which is very clean and tidy.. I won’t recommend Airbnb to anyone."

2025-04-18,1,Ignored for Days – Only Took Action After Chargeback,"I booked an Airbnb property in Thailand, which I later discovered was operating illegally—a clear sign posted in the building warned that short-term rentals were prohibited and guests could face prosecution. I flagged this to Airbnb immediately, providing photo evidence and citing their own hosting policies, yet they repeatedly ignored my concerns.

After days of silence and canned responses, I was left with no choice but to escalate the matter to my bank and initiate a chargeback. Unsurprisingly, only after the chargeback was opened did Airbnb suddenly begin responding—trying to reroute me through their internal Resolution Center, which I had already made clear I wouldn’t use due to their delayed and inadequate handling.

If you’re trusting Airbnb to protect you in serious situations, don’t. Their response was slow, dismissive, and only turned cooperative when financial pressure was applied."
2025-04-17,1,Grossly misleading listing and terrible handling from Airbnb,"We are currently staying in Madrid in an apartment booked through Airbnb, and we are deeply disappointed – both with the condition of the apartment and the way Airbnb has handled the situation.

Since our arrival, we have been in continuous contact with both the hosts and Airbnb. We raised several serious issues already on Monday – it is now Thursday (17/4-25), and nothing has been resolved. We were first told to wait for the host to contact us. Then we were told to contact the host ourselves. And so it has continued – a frustrating game of ping-pong. We are leaving on Sunday, and it’s clear that no one is taking responsibility.

The problems with the apartment are numerous and severe:

The front door cannot be properly secured – it only has a sliding bolt at the top. The windows also don’t lock. We do not feel safe.

There is a brothel in the same building, and the women working there frequently gather in front of the entrance, shouting and causing disturbances at night. This disrupts our sleep and creates a highly uncomfortable atmosphere.

The listing describes the apartment as “quiet and cozy” – this is grossly misleading.

The apartment is supposedly equipped for 8 guests, yet there are only 6 chairs and a ridiculous small extendable table.

Many of the basic amenities listed were missing upon arrival (shampoo, soap, cleaning cloth, trash bags).

Numerous things are broken or in poor condition: the balcony door, blackout blinds, toilet seat, bathroom sink, kitchen cabinets, the TV (which receives no channels), and the WiFi doesn’t reach all the rooms.

There is no hot water – we have had to boil water in order to shower.

When we used the washing machine, sewage water leaked from an unsealed pipe under in the kitchen resulting the whole apparent to stink of feces.

The apartment is dirty and reeks of cigarette smoke despite all windows being closed.

The registration of our guests has not been completed correctly, despite my attempts to resolve it with the hosts.


We requested a refund and a relocation to another apartment on Tuesday – yet by today, Thursday, the matter is still unresolved.

The listing of the apartment in Airbnb is wildly inaccurate and completely misrepresents the true state of the property. In all our years using Airbnb, we have never encountered such a poorly maintained and mismanaged accommodation.

Thank you, Airbnb, for turning what should have been a pleasant holiday in Madrid into a frustrating and outrageous experience. We will not be using Airbnb again – and we strongly advise others to stay away as well!"

My review was,
beware of a Airbnb unit which is marketed as ""Melbourne Town Hall View"" it's a one bedroom which can house upto 4 or 5 (unit number 803). Only the location which is along 115 Swanston Street (in Melbourne CBD) is true, others are jokes. The interior is congested and dirty. Basic hygiene is a major flop. Debris from previous tenants can be found. No Aircon, no TV. Swinging fan is very dusty and broken, cannot swing. Toilet seat is misplaced. Dust every where, if one has breathing issues, beware. Writer paid full for 6 nights but must leave after the first night after the unbearable conditions. Host Srinivasreddy Polareddy is dishonest, rejected to make even partial refunds. He is only eyeing to milk money out of his property at the 8th floor (he is staying on the 10th floor) but not doing enough to upkeep the contents. For those who don't believe me, you have to see for yourself.

2025-04-14,1,"10 Years of Loyalty, Treated Horribly by Airbnb","After almost 10 years of using Airbnb, I’ve now permanently deleted my account. I booked a 1-night stay with my baby and husband and arrived to find a dirty place that looked nothing like the listing.
Towels from previous guests were still hanging, a filthy kettle was left in the kitchen (completely unusable), and the host’s personal slippers were waiting at the entrance. The shelves were cluttered, the garden area was unkempt, and there were tools and unsafe items lying around, unacceptable for a family with a small child. I documented everything immediately with timestamped photos and sent them to Airbnb support.
Instead of properly addressing the situation, Airbnb offered a small partial refund and allowed the host to leave a false, defamatory review about me, including a completely made-up claim that I “falsified photos.” I declined to share the photos directly with the host (which Airbnb asked permission for) because I was concerned she would retaliate in her review and that’s exactly what she did.
Despite having perfect reviews up until this point and providing clear evidence, Airbnb refused to remove her review. It became obvious they are more interested in protecting income from hosts than protecting honest, loyal guests.

This was a final wake-up call. If you care about cleanliness, safety, and being treated fairly, I would strongly reconsider using Airbnb.

2025-04-14,1,Airbnb turns a blind eye to local law violations and guest safety,"I honestly expected better from Airbnb.

I did everything right — took photos and video, left immediately, and asked for a partial refund for the nights I didn’t stay.

Airbnb’s response?
	•	First, they told me the host has “all the proper documents.”
	•	Then they ignored the part where the building literally forbids Airbnb and the host admitted it.
	•	Then they shifted focus to bedbugs and said I need to provide medical records or blood stains. Seriously? Was I supposed to sit there and wait to be bitten so I can bleed on their sheets for evidence?

At no point did they acknowledge the safety concerns.
From the start, they clearly took the host’s side and just kept copy-pasting policy fragments without actually reviewing anything.

I used to trust Airbnb, but after this whole absurd process, I’m done. I’ll think twice next time — and so should you.

2025-04-13,1,Booking made without my knowledge:  Airbnb refused to refund monies ,"Airbnb nightmare:  Booking made without my consent   $1200 taken. Airbnb refuse to provide refund nor the details of who booked or device it was booked on etc, despite my pleas *o do so. 

I went to check my bank account Saturday morning as I have been away a granddaughter who is seriously ill, on the Sunshine Coast.

Imagine my shock and horror when seeing a much higher balance owing than there should have been  - $1200 in fact.  Quickly saw the problem - an AirBnB booking I had never made - I havent touched Airbnb for 10 months and that $1200 'stolen' out of my account not authorised by me, is needed for medical interventions not available in Australia.

After reporting the issue to ANZ bank, and cancelling my card, they told me to contact Airbnb to see what had happened to get my money back.

Well there upon, the joke began - but the joke (and theft) is on me.  AirBnB are shocking and that is too kind a description.  Their customer service is rotten to the core and after trying to find which took hours, they were abysmal.  Flimsy.  Not appropriate at all for a massive institution handling mega funds.  
 First of all I could not understand them.  I asked them to slow down.  The first one just would not, seemingly deliberately making it hard for me.

Airbnb's thin pretense of a problem solving complaints department is most certainly not that. just an excuse for one. I had to tell the person I did not understand what the problem was, and that I required a snap shots of who made the booking, time, on what device, messages between host and the person impersonating me.

AirBnb said their protocol was a reviewer would contact me when able and give me a decision.  I told them I was not even home at the time of booking but in hospital with my GD who is unresponsive in episodes and that I wear a bum bag around my waist 24 hours so as not to lose or misplace my phone and credit card.  

The condescending review came back from some one called Leon to say he could find no evidence of interference and I'd basically have to wear the $1200.  End of.  Goodbye.  With no avenue to right of reply or request for further information as these reviews are done by some flimsy phantom entity on no reply emails.   OMG.  Shocking

For the next few hours I sort to get back to reconnect with another reviewer which eventually happened but same response as with Leon.  Washed their hands of me.  I have again been told sorry, you are  not entitled, your bad, basically that someone in   your household must have got hold of your account.  Then goodbye, Airbnb is closing the case and recourse, no more to be heard.  If I report to the issue to police, they  provided a link.   Left hanging like a shag on a rock- excuse my language. 

How condescending and rude, AirBnb.  You have stolen my money in my book and refuse to provide  me the pathway I have requested showing how when
 and where plus what device, this booking was made.  They just ignore my request so I have no way of establishing how this happened, and if it could happen again.  Disgusting almost fraudulent manner of handling peoples money and bookings.  Airbnb stated that the host didnt provide refunds. However when I spoke to the host, she said Airbnb would sure refund the deposit.  So Airbnb is indulging in midleading behavior.  I believe Australia needs to do a full review of Airbnb business practices. as it is clearly substandard and allowed to handle enormous amounts of money.  

Lesson to be learned:  
1. remove your credit card from Airbnb site and only install when booking 
2. Dont trust Airbnb, check your accounts regularly for unauthorised activity on your accounts

 did get hold of the host and they were lovely but while I asked, whether rightly or wrongly if they could see their way clear to refunding the almost $1200 paid already, I have had no response but prior to my request, they did say they felt positive Airbnb would refund the $1200 deposit.

However in one of the reviewers responses, he stated that the host did not provide refunds, whereas the host in a message said they believed Airbnb would refund my monies taken without my knowledge or consent.  Moral of this story:  remove credit cards in between transactions

2025-04-12,4,Beware of the “golden badge on Airbnb,"Beware of the “golden badge on Airbnb: my experience as a host with 4 properties

I used to trust Airbnb’s algorithm that assigns the well-known golden badge to listings marked as “guest favorites,” with a percentage showing how they rank compared to others. As a traveler, I often picked listings based on that badge, thinking it was a reliable sign of quality.
But now, as a host with years of experience and four different properties listed on the platform, I’ve started to question it—and honestly, I’ve changed my mind.

My best-performing listing, a beautiful apartment with a sea view, high-end interiors, an amazing location, glowing 5-star reviews, and a consistently high booking rate… no longer has the golden badge.

Meanwhile, my other listings— beautiful as well, same location, same place, in a top position as well, but less popular, no sea view, —still have the badge. This has led me to a simple but disappointing conclusion: the algorithm is not reliable.

As someone who manages multiple listings, I’ve been able to compare them directly, and I can confidently say that whether or not a listing has the badge doesn’t always reflect its actual quality or guest satisfaction.

MY ADVICE as an experienced host:
Don’t rely on the GOLDEN  badge to choose your vacation stay.
Always read real REVIEWS, look at the photos, check the details of the home, and pay attention to how the host communicates.

The algorithm can be wrong. Real guest experiences aren’t.

2025-04-11,2,Disappointed by Airbnb’s Treatment of…,"Disappointed by Airbnb’s Treatment of Longstanding Hosts

I have been a loyal Airbnb host for over six years, proudly maintaining Superhost status and receiving mostly 5-star reviews from wonderful guests. Hosting has never just been a business to me — it’s something I’ve poured my heart, time, and care into.

Unfortunately, my recent experience with Airbnb Support has left me feeling completely disheartened.

A guest left a poor review on my listing after a rare, temporary water issue in my town — an external problem entirely beyond my control, which affected many homes in the area. I reached out to Airbnb, not to silence the guest, but to ask for understanding, fairness, and at the very least the chance to update my response to the review professionally.

Instead, I was met with rigid, robotic responses, no empathy, and even received a warning threatening suspension from the platform if I receive another low-star review — despite the fact that I have a long, proven track record of excellent hosting. Shockingly, they referenced a 3-star review from last September, completely ignoring the countless 5-star reviews I’ve worked hard to earn.

This experience has made me feel that Airbnb no longer values its hosts as people — only as numbers on a screen. There was no kindness, no consideration of the circumstances, and no support for someone who has given years of loyal service to their platform.

My hope in writing this review is that Airbnb reflects on how they treat their hosts — especially those who genuinely care and take pride in creating beautiful guest experiences.

We deserve to feel valued, supported, and treated with fairness — not fear.

2025-04-11,1,Airbnb Allowed a Retaliatory Review to Stay ,"Airbnb Allowed a Retaliatory, Misleading Review to Stay—Despite Clear Evidence. Hosts Beware.

Hey fellow Hosts,

I wanted to share an experience that I believe speaks to a larger issue in how Airbnb handles unfair reviews—and how helpless we can be, even when we follow all the right steps.

A recent guest left me a retaliatory and completely misleading review after I reported legitimate issues with their behavior during their stay. I submitted clear evidence showing the review was written solely in retaliation, which is explicitly against Airbnb’s own Review Policy (Article 546). Yet, despite multiple attempts to dispute it, Airbnb not only refused to remove the review but closed my case with vague, copy-pasted replies and no proper explanation.

Here’s what I was told:

> “The case is now closed… we do not have a way to override it… we appreciate your understanding.”



No, I don’t understand—and I won’t quietly accept it.

Their “specialized team” never addressed how the review didn’t violate their retaliation or misleading content policy. They simply dismissed it and shut down further appeal.

I’ve now started preparing to escalate this externally—to the press, watchdog groups, and online communities—because I believe this case reflects a serious flaw in how Airbnb protects (or fails to protect) its Hosts. If they won’t uphold their own policies, what are we even agreeing to as Hosts?

If this has happened to you, please speak up. We need transparency, accountability, and a review system that doesn’t allow bad actors to damage our reputations with impunity.

Happy to share the full details privately if anyone is interested—or wants to join forces to get Host voices heard."

2025-04-09,1,Significant Safety and Support Concerns with Airbnb,"I recently had a deeply troubling experience during my Airbnb stay in Strasbourg, which has profoundly affected my view of the platform’s commitment to safety and proper host vetting. Below is a summary of my experience:

Host Background Checks: The incident underscored a significant flaw in Airbnb's processes—specifically, the absence of comprehensive background checks for hosts. The host displayed erratic and abusive behavior, possibly worsened by untreated health or mental health issues, significantly compromising my safety and comfort.

Host Behavior and Eviction: The problems started when the host entered my room without permission after I complained about the lack of adequate heating in the apartment. The situation escalated rapidly, culminating in my being unfairly and abruptly asked to leave the property without any justified reason.

Airbnb’s Response: Although Airbnb covered the costs for three nights at a hotel, they did not provide a true refund for the turmoil caused. Moreover, they allowed the host to remain active on the platform, despite clear signs of potentially dangerous behavior.

Financial and Emotional Impact: Airbnb's resolution did not fully alleviate the financial burden or the emotional distress I suffered. The urgency of finding emergency accommodations added substantial stress during an already challenging period.

Lack of Accountability: Airbnb’s management of the issue revealed a disturbing disregard for serious misconduct by the host. It seemed their main concern was to avoid legal responsibility, rather than to offer real support to the affected guests.

Conclusion and Caution to Others: This ordeal has led me to question the reliability of Airbnb for secure accommodations. Prospective guests should be aware of the risks associated with inadequately vetted hosts, particularly regarding their mental and physical health.

This experience is a stark reminder for anyone using Airbnb about the inherent risks of the platform. Airbnb needs to enhance its host vetting procedures and accept greater responsibility for guest safety to avoid similar incidents in the future.

When you agree to use Airbnb, you essentially accept all risks involved, as the platform does not conduct thorough background checks on hosts. This means a host could potentially have a criminal record and still maintain an active profile on Airbnb.

These are the terms of AirBnb - 
3.2 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 9), including your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services."
2025-04-09,1,Basically feels like a scam,"Basically feels like a scam. Your reservation is not confirmed - it can seemingly be ended at any point, most likely when the owner finds someone who wants to stay longer than you do and their dates include yours >> your 'confirmation' is meaningless, your supposed reservation cancelled without explanation. Also, AirB&B is a US company - make you own mind up if you want to contribute to their earnings."
2025-04-09,1,Rubbish Customer support,"First time I have used Airbnb and it's been  a nightmare. I received confirmation of the booking but it was then cancelled because of a problem with verification. Surely verification should be required before a booking is made/confirmed?

I contacted Airbnb support and provided all evidence, but they only offered me £10 for a situation that cost me several hundred pounds.

Their senior case managers kept repeating the same message and refused to take real responsibility. I expected Airbnb to protect its guests and support them when things go wrong. Instead, I was left feeling abandoned and unprotected.

I am now forced to file a chargeback through my bank and escalate this case to consumer protection authorities. This was a terrible experience, and I no longer trust Airbnb.

2025-04-08,1,Disappointed in Airbnb’s Lack of Guest Protection,"Title: Disappointed in Airbnb’s Lack of Guest Protection

I recently had a really frustrating experience with Airbnb that left me feeling completely unprotected as a guest. The apartment I booked was not clean on arrival — crumbs on the floor, sticky spots, hygiene issues in the bathroom, and missing amenities that were clearly listed. I messaged the host right away, and while she was polite, she insisted her cleaner had been there and said, “This has never happened before,” which felt more like dismissal than accountability.

I followed all the proper channels: I documented everything, explained why I couldn’t report within 72 hours (I was alone in a foreign country and afraid I’d be left without housing), and even cleaned the space myself. When I submitted a partial refund request, Airbnb responded by saying it was entirely up to the host to approve — meaning that even if a listing doesn’t match reality, guests have no real protection unless the host agrees to take responsibility.

Airbnb claims to support guests, but this experience showed me otherwise. It feels like there’s no meaningful process in place when a stay goes wrong — and no consequences for misleading listings or poor conditions. I didn’t want a full refund, just a fair one. Instead, I was left feeling dismissed, unsupported, and out of options.

If Airbnb truly wants to be a trusted platform, it needs to take guest reports seriously and have systems in place that don’t rely solely on the goodwill of hosts.

2025-04-08,1, Extremely Disappointing Experience with Airbnb – Lack of Support and Host Negligence,"My experience with Airbnb and the host of an apartment in Curitiba Brazil!!! was extremely negative and disappointing. What should have been a relaxing stay turned into a nightmare.

Upon arriving at the property, I noticed serious safety issues: the apartment, located on the 15th floor, had no window screens, which posed a significant risk, especially since I was sick and accompanied by my young grandson. When I asked the host to install window screens, he responded insensitively and negligently, saying he raised his daughter in the same environment and ""nothing happened."" This was irresponsible and disrespectful of my safety and that of other guests.

Additionally, the advertised single bed was not suitable; it was actually a low children's bed, something the host admitted but minimized. Despite not using the apartment even for a single night, the host refused to refund the full amount and insisted I pay 50% of the stay.

The worst part was the lack of support from Airbnb. I had to resolve the dispute with the help of my bank, as Airbnb did nothing to assist me. Furthermore, the host changed the listing after my complaint, adding the information about the lack of window screens, which was never mentioned in the original listing. This clearly shows an attempt to hide flaws after the fact.

Today, I am no longer seeking a refund, as my bank handled the situation. What I really want is to report this kind of behavior so that other guests don’t go through the same ordeal.

Warning to everyone: If you're booking with Airbnb, carefully check reviews and be prepared to deal with the platform's lack of support.

We recently booked a stay through Airbnb and were met with a clearly misleading cancellation policy. The listing read:

“Free cancellation for 48 hours. Get a full refund if you change your mind.”

Naturally, we understood this to mean cancellation was allowed up to 48 hours before check-in — as is standard in most booking platforms. Only after trying to cancel (five days in advance) did we learn it actually meant 48 hours after booking. This deceptive wording is not the host’s doing — it’s Airbnb’s platform design.

Airbnb refused to take responsibility, falling back on technical fine print and ignoring the misleading nature of the language. Its support claimed we “had the option” to read the full policy. However, the listing wording gave us no reason to think that was necessary. It created a false sense of flexibility and led us to believe we were within our rights to cancel.

As longtime users of the platform, we’re deeply disappointed by this lack of transparency and customer support.

We’re sharing this to help others avoid the same experience — and to hold Airbnb accountable for what we believe amounts to misleading advertising.

I booked an apartment in Thailand through Airbnb for 16 days. I later learned that this type of short-term rental violates Thai law (the Hotel Act), which prohibits rentals of less than 30 days without a hotel license.

The host explicitly told me not to mention Airbnb at the front desk — clearly trying to hide the booking. I have screenshots of this conversation.

When I contacted Airbnb customer service, they:
- refused to pay any compensation,
- did not apologize,
- and most importantly, admitted that they do not check the legality of listings.

Direct quote from their response:

“Airbnb does not conduct due diligence on each listing or confirm compliance with local laws in each jurisdiction.”

In other words, Airbnb is fully aware that listings on their platform may be illegal, but they continue to accept them — and profit from them — while passing on all the legal risks to guests.

I also informed Airbnb that I may file a complaint with the Thai tourist police, as I was not warned that the rentals may be illegal. Airbnb's response? ""Case closed.""

Case ID: A46070227

My conclusion:
Airbnb is not responsible — even when their users are exposed to potentially illegal situations. This is dangerous, unethical, and completely unacceptable. If you are traveling to countries with strict short-term rental laws (Thailand, Japan, Italy, etc.) — Airbnb will not protect you."
2025-04-06,1,Really awful service,Really awful service. Don’t even know where to begin. 
2025-04-06,1,Just terrible,"Just terrible! Avoid at all costs.
I arrived at the structure and Airbnb in the meantime cancelled my paid reservation to book another client.
This is fraud and disregard of contract. 
I wasn't even notified 
They are criminals "
2025-04-06,1,Harsh penalties with no flexibility,"I am writing as an airbnb host of a very successful self catering holiday let. I have a near perfect record, all 5 stars from 350 reviews with one 4 star. My place is booked year round so I earn airbnn approx £5,000 a year in host and guest commission. A couple of months ago I had a Christmas booking for 2025. I cancelled it. I am not in the habit of cancelling guests. This is my first in 4 years. But I gave them 10 months notice so they had plenty of time to find something else. As a result of this I've paid 10% penalty of the cost of the booking, I've lost my superhost status and I've been made less visible in searches. I complained to airbnb about this and was informed this is their policy. There is no flexibility to allow for the fact that I have an excellent record or that I gave the guests 10 months notice. I am disgusted by my treatment. "
2025-04-05,1,I am very sad,"Airbnb deceives its customers. The user interface and usability on the mobile app are lacking. It's easy to accidentally press the wrong button, resulting in an unintended booking. One feature, apparently, is that when you search for an accommodation and send a booking request, the property later reappears in the search results. Now, the same property shows as unavailable for the dates you're looking for. Naturally, you think the host has later marked the property as unavailable. However, it's actually Airbnb that continues to suggest this property to the user.

I personally experienced this when I thought the property was unavailable and began searching for an alternative, which I found and booked. Almost simultaneously, the host of the first property confirmed the booking, and suddenly, I had two accommodations booked. It was impossible to explain this situation to customer support.
""The accessibility of the support is very poor. Firstly, the people only speak broken German or English, whichever it may be. Reliable callbacks are offered, but they do not happen. What makes me suspicious is that on the answering machine, it is mentioned that I will be contacted by a member of Airbnb. It should be correct to say that employees are being mentioned, not members—what’s the deal with that?""
It's sad that such a large company uses these methods to improve quarterly results and present itself better to investors.

""The support is almost impossible to reach, the staff doesn't speak the language, and they don't follow through with their promise to call back after they’ve looked into the issue. In the future, I will only use Airbnb for emergencies. If possible, I’ll book directly with the provider, as that’s an option if you know how.""

2025-04-05,1,I recently discovered unauthorized…,"I recently discovered unauthorized charges were withdrawn from my account in regards to a recent stay at one of my properties. The guest has already received all of their money back, but I had the absolute unpleasure of working with Luna with Airbnb who has repeatedly messaged me regarding the issues with my home, sending threatening and rude messages. After I asked her not to message me, she continued to send messages. One being 9:45PM. When I asked her not to send messages after 9PM, she sent the next one at 1:30AM. Then, because I got angry with her, now she is retaliating by taking $370 dollars from my account! This is THEFT!  When I call, no one will talk to me, call me, resolve this ... NOTHING. Now, they are just going to steal money from my account after this issues was ALREADY PAID OUT! They have taken over $3,000 from my account in the last 3 months!! How is this legal?? This is not the level of professionalism or transparency I expect from a global company. I am requesting a full investigation into the unauthorized charges and a formal explanation of the billing practices. I also urge Airbnb to improve their customer support and communication processes. I'm a ""SuperHost"" ... do you value us or not?  Stop stealing from your customers!! "

Exceptional Support from Airbnb During the Bangkok Earthquake

Our stay in Bangkok took an unexpected turn when we experienced an earthquake. It was a nerve-wracking experience, but Airbnb’s Safety Team—especially Amy, Simona, Eric, and Ronnie—stepped in immediately and made sure we were safe and supported.

From the moment they reached out, they showed genuine concern, checking in regularly and offering assistance. They not only provided clear communication but also offered to cover hotel costs if we needed to relocate. Knowing we had that option gave us peace of mind in an otherwise stressful situation. When we needed to find a longer-term stay, they even helped with a booking coupon to cover part of the cost.

The original property was great, but what truly stood out was the level of care and professionalism from the Airbnb team. In a moment of uncertainty, they made us feel valued and reassured. This experience has given me an even greater appreciation for Airbnb—not just as a platform, but as a company that genuinely prioritizes its guests.

Huge thanks to Amy, Simona, Eric, and Ronnie for everything. Your kindness and quick action made all the difference!

I cannot edit without email, phone calls and text messages and so far i have been ask two times if the problem was solved when nothing has been done on the issue i asked for help with. As a host I am left hanging in the wind and hoping for the best"
2025-04-03,1,Really Disappointing,"The place I stayed in was nothing like the pictures. It was dirty, had broken stuff everywhere, and honestly, I felt scammed. The host didn’t care at all when I messaged them. On top of that, the customer service was no help—just gave me the runaround."

2025-04-03,1,Message to all guests from a super host. DON’T BOOK ON THIS PLATFORM,"I am a superhost on Airbnb. Last year on a new property I listed I received an early review of a 3 from a guest who retaliated to my requests that they keep the after hours noise down for fellow residents in the building (it’s a no-party unit so no excuse). 
Part of the review stated a “dirty stairwell with excessive dust” for the communal stairs and gave a 2 for cleaning! I’ve been a host for 8 years and my places are spotless. 

Airbnb ignored my protest and request to remove the review. 

ALL SUBSEQUENT REVIEWS ON THIS APARTMENT HAVE SCORED ME A 5* rating so I was absolutely horrified to be told last week by Airbnb that my listing will be REMOVED on May 2nd because I got a 3* review last year 😳 😱

I immediately appealed and took screenshots of all the subsequent excellent reviews. To no avail. I’ve been advised they will “uphold” their decision and remove my listing. 

I have 42 guests who have booked with me between now and September - I now have to create a new listing on booking.com and try to get the guests to trust me and move across. I still have the property and still have the ability to host … it’s ridiculous!

If you are a guest reading this DONT BOOK ON THIS PLATFORM. As hosts we are at the mercy of the irrational and unprofessional policies of Airbnb that change every time you speak to a new robot or automated system. I have no faith left and am moving everything over to VRBO and booking.com. It’s not always us hosts that let you down …"

2025-04-02,1,Staff is impersonating management and lying,"Staff is impersonating management, directly lying and wasting my time. Had a small issue but this will reported to the authorities as it is anarchy ,see the screenshot. I spent circa 1.5 hours on calls with them, Indian call centre, when they failed their promises - no email sent as promised on call, impersonates manager when asked for one , get this, when I complained on the thread and said I recorded them lying ( note they record all calls so it is legal) within 13min decides to close the conversation 

For legal purposes the agent impersinated a supervisor and agreed to provide email regarding the nearly 40min call

this is for timestamping and legal purposes

please note will be raising this as a formal complaint and as such , direct lies and impersonation of senior staff will be accounted for. I take this matter seriously

AIRBNB if Compliance Team is reading this , your customer service is going to the dogs, Indian Call Centre and zero customer service is gonna do some severe damage."
2025-04-02,1,Awful company,"Awful company. The host of the place I booked for my 30th birthday cancelled 3 weeks after accepting as they wanted more money (we had booked 2 days over the May bank holiday weekend originally but she comes back as says she needs to offer it to people who can stay over the full 3 days). This is 3 weeks after confirming our booking and we had prepared everything for our trip. The host told Air B & B that they couldn't have us stay because the property was under maintenance but we have a message from the host which clearly states she needs a booking over the full 3 days and not 2. We rang Air B&B and spent over an hour trying to raise a complaint to be put on hold over and over again, as they hoped we would hang up. We eventually managed to speak to a 'manager' who said the call was recorded for training and monitoring purposes. When we responded saying we are also recording the call, they quickly hung up the phone as they know they weren't complying with the correct complaint process. We then requested a full refund for the trip, but were instead given air b and b credits with a petty £32 compensation which doesn't even cover the train tickets my friends bought to get to the house. We have never dealt with such an unprofessional company in our entire lives and will never use this company ever again. And now we have less than 2 months left to try and organise a 30th birthday for 16 people which has caused a huge amount of time and distress. DO NOT USE AIR B&B if we had read the reviews before we would have ran a mile!"
2025-04-02,1,Never Again!!!,After driving 16 hours I looked forward to what Air B&B advertised as a quiet private place was nothing of the sort! No mention that a family of 5 with 3 small children would be staying 5 feet away from me in my so called quiet/private place. I called Air B&B to cancel my stay 15 minuites after arriving. They thought it was fair to keep half of the over $500 I paid for 4 nights! Do yourself a favor & forget Air B&B and checkout places when you get to your destination instead of relying on their BS advertising description & pics of the places that might have been nice years ago!
2025-04-02,1,RIDICULOUS,"I am new to air bnb, I stayed at one place and everything was fine. Good stay, photos were genuine, no problems. 
The next time I tried to book a place they wouldn’t authorise it because of a potential “party” 
It’s mind blowing why they do this, or the fact they assume u will throw a party in a one bedroom apartment booked for 2 people. The bedroom is only big enough for 2 people and there is only one other room!! It would be a Terrible place if you wanted to party. 
I never hosted any party in my life and neither do I even drink alcohol!! "
2025-04-02,1,Rented an airport where for 6 months…,"Rented an airport where for 6 months previous planned works were due to be carried out.Both agent/owner not interested and Airbnb basically offered back the extra deposit plus about £60. This after a two month rent of which the first month not useable. Told to accept offer or case closed.
Do not rent or believe any advert front Airbnb unless you obtain a written guarantee that the advert and condition is truthful."
2025-04-01,1,"Traumatizing, Discriminatory Experience & Zero Accountability from Airbnb","I’m sharing this in the hope that no one else has to go through what I experienced. I was forcibly removed from this property based on false and discriminatory accusations made by the host and building manager. The manager called the police, who conducted a public stop-and-search. Despite the humiliation and anxiety this caused, I cooperated fully. The police found no drugs, no rule-breaking, and confirmed there was no evidence of any wrongdoing.

I followed all the house rules. Yet I was publicly accused, humiliated, and evicted. What’s worse is that I was the only guest targeted—despite the smell of cannabis throughout the property and other white, elderly guests staying at the same time. They were never questioned. I was singled out, and I firmly believe this was because I am a young Black woman. The treatment I received was discriminatory, dehumanizing, and completely unjust.

To make matters worse, Airbnb canceled my reservation shortly after the police left—without ever contacting me for my side of the story. I was left without accommodation at short notice, no support, no rebooking help, and no offer of care or protection under their AirCover policy.

I paid for 16 nights, stayed for only 9, and despite being entitled to a refund, I have not been refunded the remaining amount—over £1,000. Airbnb has yet to contact me directly or provide a full resolution, despite multiple attempts on my end and clear documentation proving I did nothing wrong.

This has been a deeply traumatic experience. I trusted Airbnb to provide a safe, fair service and uphold its policies. Instead, I was met with silence, discrimination, and abandonment.

I’m speaking up because this kind of mistreatment and lack of accountability should never happen—especially on a platform that claims to care about guest safety and inclusion."
2025-04-01,1,I booked with Airbnb today,"I booked with Airbnb today, firstly they asked for my driving licence for id why they need this I don't know. So I made the booking anyway and opted to pay half now and the balance in July. When I checked my account the took the full payment. I tried contacting them but could not buy phone only by messenger, I got no reply so I had to cancel the booking completely, the thing that really annoys me is they have a photo copy of my driving licence back and front and there is nothing I can do about it. My advice is steer clear of Airbnb "

2025-04-01,1,"Bedbug nightmare – no protection, no help from Airbnb","I booked what seemed to be a clean and decent apartment through Airbnb – not a cheap place, but one at a normal, fair price. After two days, we discovered small bugs in the bed. On the third day, after a quick Google search, it became clear: bedbugs.

We immediately informed the host. Our vacation was ruined – we simply couldn’t continue. We also contacted Airbnb support right away, reporting an active bedbug infestation. The result? A small refund for the affected stay – but all other costs were left entirely up to us.

I brought the bedbugs back home with me and had to hire a professional exterminator, which cost over €500. On top of that, I tried countless anti-bedbug treatments while waiting for the exterminator appointment. I had to pay for all of this myself. Airbnb only covers a small amount for laundry – that’s it. They won’t take responsibility for anything else.

I had never dealt with bedbugs before and was completely overwhelmed. Airbnb later claimed that I should’ve undressed outside and sealed everything immediately for cleaning – but they never gave me any of this advice, not even when I first reported the issue. We were left to deal with it all on our own.

Airbnb provides no hygiene guarantee and takes no real responsibility for the hosts on their platform.
No support. No solution. No proper communication. Just psychological and logistical stress – all at your own expense.

I trusted Airbnb – and was deeply disappointed.
Never again.

2025-04-01,1,Airbnb customer service was awful ,"We used Airbnb for a rental. The rental unit then charged us for damages which we were not responsible for as those damages were there when we arrived $788.  Airbnb took their side because we had no proof and charged us. These were downright lies. I did not have pictures of these damages but did have pictures of the overall condition of the house which showed many issues. They said it was our fault for not notifying them immediately, mind you we were only staying 2 nights and many of the issues could not of been solved immediately there was mold, broken alarms, broken appliances and many more issues. I feel Airbnb was the company we used and it should be up to them to ensure the rentals are in rentable condition. Many of the reviews for this listing were not for this property which is downright deceitful!!! "
2025-04-01,1,I rented Airbnb in DC and before I even…,"I rented Airbnb in DC and before I even checked in, there were 4 shootings, 2 men got killed on the street. I immediately left and reported to the Airbnb what happened and they asked me ,”Did you get shot? Well if no, then host is not responsible to refund your 2k”. Please be aware that many hosts are unethical, dishonest and inhumane. The worst part is that guests basic human rights such as safety is fully disrespected by the Airbnb customer service which is located in India and China. That’s why they don’t care about any laws! "
2025-03-31,1,Airbnb Double-Charged Service Fees and Refused,"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Airbnb's refund policy and customer service that I feel compelled to share.

I had to cancel a 5-night reservation after the full refund window but before the 50% refund deadline. The host graciously offered to refund me once the dates were rebooked, stating: ""I can refund you once the days are rebooked. You would receive the difference if our price ended up being lower.""

Based on this promise, I immediately canceled my reservation to give the host maximum time to rebook (rather than waiting until the 50% refund deadline which would have guaranteed me a partial refund).

When the dates were rebooked, multiple issues arose:

1. The host claimed one date wasn't rebooked despite Airbnb's system showing it as unavailable
2. The refund calculation suggested an unusually low rebooking rate with no transparency
3. Most importantly, Airbnb collected service fees TWICE for the same property on the same dates - once from me and once from the new guest

Despite multiple polite requests to Airbnb support explaining this double-charging issue, they repeatedly refused to refund even the service fee portion (approximately $250), citing rigid policy adherence while ignoring the fundamental unfairness of collecting fees twice for the same dates.

Airbnb's unwillingness to address this obvious case of double-dipping on service fees has permanently damaged my trust in their platform. I've been a loyal customer for years but will be exploring alternatives for future travel.

Beware of Airbnb's refund policies - even when a host agrees to refund you based on rebooking, Airbnb will still keep all their service fees, essentially profiting twice from the same reservation dates."
2025-03-31,1,Feedback on Retaliatory Review – Request for Policy Reconsideration,"I would like to provide feedback on a recent review removal request I submitted, which was denied. As a Superhost with over three years of consistently positive feedback, I am disappointed that the review in question, which I believe to be retaliatory, was not removed.

The guest in question violated house rules, including arriving before check-in, and later left a negative review after being reminded of those rules. This type of retaliatory review undermines the fairness of the review system, as it does not reflect an honest assessment of the stay.

While I understand that the decision is final, I would like to suggest that more careful consideration be given to cases where retaliation is evident, especially when a host has a long-standing record of positive reviews and professionalism.
I hope future policies will offer more support to hosts in dealing with retaliatory reviews.

Best regards,
Ayoub"
2025-03-31,1,Airbnb Ignored Hidden Cameras & Fraudulent Charges – Still No Resolution,"We stayed at an Airbnb in Barcelona and discovered undisclosed surveillance cameras inside the apartment, including near the sleeping area and bathroom. The listing claimed there were no cameras, but the host admitted we couldn’t unplug or cover them.

We left early and reported it immediately. The unit was also dirty, had cockroaches, mold, no heat in most rooms, and missing amenities. Then we were hit with an extra $1,100 charge after leaving—on top of $2,000 we’d already paid.

We gave Airbnb:

Photos of the cameras

Screenshots of the listing

Host messages confirming the cameras


Airbnb closed the case and said the refund was “up to the host,” completely ignoring their own policies and the fact that this is a serious violation of privacy laws (GDPR + Spanish Penal Code Article 197).

We’re now filing criminal and data privacy complaints. This was my worst travel experience ever, and Airbnb’s lack of response or accountability is unacceptable.

2025-03-30,1,Slapped with a 41% extra fee and told to accept or cancel,"I booked an apartment through Airbnb in January for a stay in April. Then, out of nowhere in March, the host messaged me saying they “made a calculation error” and increased the price by 234€—from 560€ to 794€. That’s a 41% increase, after the booking was confirmed and paid for.

I contacted Airbnb support expecting help. Instead, I got told to either “accept the new price or cancel.” That’s it. No protection. No real recourse.

I had to dig through Airbnb’s own host policies, which clearly say that once a booking is made, the price can’t be changed unless the guest agrees—and if the guest refuses, the host is expected to cancel. So why did the whole issue get pushed on to me instead of the host?

Airbnb offered me a 20% discount on the price difference (only the difference!!) if I rebooked elsewhere in their application—meaning I still get to pay more, just a bit less more. That’s not compensation, that’s a joke.

To make matters worse, when I tried to leave feedback about this support experience, the review link had conveniently expired by the time I got my refund. And of course, I couldn’t review the host either, because I didn’t end up staying—even though I wanted to.

This platform protects its hosts, not its guests. Hosts can change the deal, and Airbnb won’t back you up. Instead, you’re left scrambling or paying extra. Total lack of accountability, and a support system that just pushes you toward refunding and no repercussions for the host."
2025-03-30,1,Airbnb gave strangers access to my apartment—and now wants me to pay again to relocate,"I’m a female with a disability (multiple sclerosis) and a registered service dog. I booked a 1-month Airbnb in Vigo, Spain (Rua Pracer 19, 1º Izquierda), and paid nearly €1000 for four weeks. But within the first two weeks, four different sets of neighbors were able to unlock my private apartment door using their Airbnb-issued digital app (AKILES system).

Yes—four different sets of strangers were given access to my home by the Airbnb host. And Airbnb is perfectly okay with this.

One group entered in the middle of the night while I was asleep. I was lucky—my service dog barked and scared them away. The others opened the door during the day, believing the apartment was theirs—because the app told them so.

Airbnb gave the same access link to multiple guests.
My apartment became a garage sale labeled “take anything you want.”
No cameras. No lock changes. No accountability from the host or Airbnb.

I was terrified to leave for days. I had to stay on lockdown inside the apartment and place a heavy suitcase behind the door at night, afraid someone else would enter again.
I have multiple sclerosis—and stress worsens my condition.
This situation was nothing but stress, fear, and complete insecurity.

Every single time I reported an incident, they told me the issue was “fixed.” They even sent screenshots. So I went to the latest neighbor and asked him to test it.

Guess what? He opened my door. Again. I filmed it.

And what does Airbnb offer me now?
	•	Not a proper relocation.
	•	Not a real solution.
	•	No apology. No compensation.

Instead, they offer 1–3 nights in a hotel (paid upfront by me), or 7 nights in another Airbnb (also paid upfront by me).
Let that sink in:
They want me to PAY AGAIN, upfront.

Let me be clear:
	•	I already paid for 4 weeks.
	•	I only “enjoyed” 2 of them—if you can call it that.
	•	I still have 2 weeks left, already paid and unused.
	•	And Airbnb wants me to pay again to be relocated.

How is that not a scam?

They refuse to take responsibility.
They gaslight—sending copy-pasted replies like “we’re sorry you feel that way,” while ignoring every piece of evidence I’ve provided.

They have video evidence, screenshots, and a full chat log showing they allowed unauthorized entries and still failed to protect me, my health, my service dog, and my belongings.

This is not customer service.
This is not a “misunderstanding.”
This is corporate negligence, discrimination, gaslighting, and a total failure to protect the safety and rights of their guests. And it is illegal, because they allowed strangers to repeatedly break into my rental.

Airbnb: You endangered me. You endangered my service dog. You violated my privacy. You’ve done nothing but deflect.
And now you expect me to pay for your mistake?

I don’t think so.
This will not stay silent.

2025-03-29,1,Never Ever anymore Airbnb! Super insecure and no any clients support in practice ,"Literally, I wish I could give Zero, but there is none of those grades!! 
Terrible clients and security support! I booked a space from the host in Madrid which was presumably rated as a good one, but it's such a cheating! She is not only mislead with infos and space description which is literally terrible to stay in where everything is broken, you can't use even warm water to take a shower because the host put only 100 litres and she rents even the space to several people (different rooms) what I wasn't aware prior coming to Madrid!! I was really speechless, but this was a least problem with all broken stuff etc. 
The host is revealed to be super below any reasonable educated people, who not only lied with infos about the space, but also insulted me because of towel with some blood spots (I had an accident) yelling at me. Besides, she entered my space while I was away checking my stuff ( I could notice it right immediately when I came to my room for change for another art event from ARCO in Madrid), plus I had my cards around on there table, etc.
But, Airbnb, while being provided with all my messaged and screenshots, after weeks of so called ""investigation"" reverted to me saying that they didn't notice any private intrusion for my space and that I have to read their terms and policy. In fact, it's written that it's violation when host enters guests space without any reason, without noticing, but Airbnb doesn't want to block this host. No wonder, they profiting a lot and don't really care about the guests security! I'm going to bring this case out, plus contacting to CEOs plus asking attorney/lawyer to claim this company!! Hopefully, people will stop using this ignorant and super unprofessional platform! No secure and no guarantee. 
Hypothetically, if tomorrow, the host will attack me, I'm afraid the Airbnb won't do anything! 
 Should this situation happen in Austria, where police does its job, and where I speak German, of course, I would have called to police immediately, where host would get troubles! "
2025-03-29,1,🚨 Airbnb Scammed Me & Let a Host Retaliate 🚨,"I booked an Airbnb-recommended listing, only to find out it was possibly fake—the host canceled last minute and pushed me into an off-platform apartment. The unit was dirty, unprepared, and missing key access, forcing me to rely on building security to enter.

I reported everything to Airbnb support, who promised me a full refund. But instead of holding the host accountable, Airbnb let her leave a completely false, retaliatory review accusing me of trashing the apartment (I have photo proof that it was spotless when I left).

Even worse? An Airbnb rep CONFIRMED the review was retaliatory and should be removed—yet Airbnb refuses to do anything. Now, I’m stuck with a fake bad review AND no refund.

Why is Airbnb protecting fraudulent hosts? Why are they recommending inactive or fake listings? Why are they ignoring their own policies?

This isn’t just bad customer service—it’s outright fraud and negligence. If Airbnb won’t fix this, I’ll be taking further action.

@Airbnb, do better.

I offer tours (or Airbnb Experiences) on Airbnb. Airbnb is by far the most frustrating company I've ever had to deal with. It is impossible to get customer support on the phone. Instead, you can talk to a Support Ambassador, who will endlessly stall and deliberately confuse the issue. These so called Support Ambassadors don't have any clearance and only very limited access to their own system. It's just a helpdesk in India where people who barely speak English just read from a script for the dozens of different companies they pretend to be the helpdesk for. They have no interest, nor any clearance, to assist with any issues.

This company adheres a very strange mix of woke, progressive, capitalist socialism and to be honest, it is sickening to one's core. Countless technical hiccups, a total disregard for their clients and their desires, ignorant or simply disinterested support, and a lot of condescending semi-aggressive verbal slander is what you can expect from this company."
2025-03-28,1,They do not follow regulations to protect customers,"Airbnb do not follow the PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication regulation which is in effect, meaning additional checks are required to protect customers from online fraud. As a result, my UK bank declines transactions. Airbnb customer support are very nice and polite, but all they can suggest is to pay with PayPal. This is not helpful. "
2025-03-28,1,Last time I’ll be using Airbnb,Last time I’ll be using Airbnb! Tried booking using the payment method Klarna - payment was taken by AIRBNB as stated on my bank statement but they are refusing to admit any wrongdoing and keep saying there is no payment on their side. I’ve shown the screenshot of $491.85 taken by their company on my bank statement and they’re still saying they can’t see any transaction!

Airbnb sided with the host despite no evidence, and they ignored their own Host Damage Policy. I filed complaints with the California Attorney General, FTC, and BBB. Extremely disappointed in Airbnb’s resolution process and lack of accountability."

2025-03-27,1,The Airbnb property had several issues…,"The Airbnb property had several issues from the beginning of my stay. I initially hoped the host would address and resolve the problems, but after a few days, the host stopped responding entirely. I waited for 10 days without any communication, then contacted Airbnb support to report the following issues:

Essential supplies were not replenished

The main door lock batteries were dead

Locks on the bedroom and bathroom doors were not working

Other general maintenance problems

Airbnb informed me that I could either continue my stay or leave the property, and they would provide a 30% discount/credit for the affected duration. Given the location of my children’s school, moving to another Airbnb was not a practical option, so I chose to stay despite the unresolved issues.

Throughout the remainder of my stay, neither the host nor Airbnb made any effort to resolve these problems. Then on March 27, 2025, Airbnb issued a refund of only $81.37 as compensation, which does not reflect the level of inconvenience experienced by me and my family.

Additionally, during a more recent call, Airbnb mentioned their “AirCover” policy for the first time—this was not brought up or explained during my earlier conversations with their support team. This lack of transparency further contributed to the poor experience and confusion around my rights and available options."
2025-03-27,1,"English: Booking not accepted, left on the street with two kids – no help from Airbnb","On March 27, I booked a stay in Ulm for myself and my two small children through Airbnb, with a check-in time of 14:00. The system allowed me to request the booking at 12:34, only 26 minutes before check-in, without any warning that the host may have up to 24 hours to respond. The host never replied, and we were left standing in a foreign city with no accommodation and two young kids.

I contacted Airbnb support and was told that ""the system works as expected"" – but how can it be acceptable that a booking request is accepted just before check-in, with no guarantee of confirmation?

No responsibility was taken, no compensation was offered, and my complaint was dismissed. This is unacceptable and dangerous, especially for families. Airbnb's system design creates risks, and the company does not protect its users when things go wrong.

I strongly advise others to think twice before using Airbnb.
Am 27. März habe ich über Airbnb eine Unterkunft in Ulm für mich und meine zwei kleinen Kinder gebucht – mit Check-in um 14:00 Uhr. Die Plattform hat meine Buchungsanfrage um 12:34 Uhr zugelassen, nur 26 Minuten vorher, ohne jeglichen Hinweis darauf, dass der Gastgeber bis zu 24 Stunden Zeit für die Antwort hat. Der Gastgeber hat nicht reagiert, und wir standen ohne Unterkunft in einer fremden Stadt.

Der Airbnb-Support sagte mir lediglich: „Das System funktioniert wie erwartet.“ Aber wie kann es richtig sein, eine Buchung so kurz vor dem Check-in zu ermöglichen, ohne die rechtzeitige Bestätigung sicherzustellen?

Airbnb hat keine Verantwortung übernommen, keine Hilfe angeboten, und meine Beschwerde wurde abgelehnt. Das ist fahrlässig, unsicher und familienfeindlich.  

Ich kann Airbnb unter diesen Umständen nicht weiterempfehlen.

2025-03-27,1,Host added additional costs at the end of the booking process,"I booked an apartment in Sicily and at the very end of the process (I had even paid the down payment), the host added 74E to the price. I questioned it but they stood firm. I tried to contact airbnb but it was frustratingly difficult. I had 24 hours to find somewhere else to stay or cancel my flight. I felt exhausted and couldn't find anywhere else to stay that I liked, so I cancelled my flight, which cost me £50. I have cancelled my account with airbnb and will not use them again. Anyone who cares about housing issues should not use them either. "

I think this service is managed by A.I. But beyond them there is an Artificial Insanity.

2025-03-25,1,Disappointed by Airbnb's Biased Review Removal Process,"I recently had a disappointing experience where my honest, policy-compliant review of a stay was removed after the host disputed it. Airbnb claimed it was retaliatory, but made this decision without asking me for any additional context or evidence. It felt like they automatically sided with the host instead of conducting a fair and balanced review of both sides.

As a long-time customer, I expected Airbnb to protect honest feedback, not silence it without giving me a real chance to explain. If hosts can get critical reviews removed this easily, it undermines the trust and accountability the platform is supposed to support.

As a long-time guest, I expected Airbnb to protect honest feedback, not silence it without a fair review. If hosts can simply get critical reviews taken down, it undermines trust in the entire platform."

2025-03-25,1,I booked a long-term stay via Airbnb,"I booked a long-term stay via Airbnb, expecting a livable, peaceful space as described. What I got was unbearable: nonstop noise in the shared living room, loud TV and music until 3AM and from 8AM again. There was no mention of this situation in the listing when I booked. After my complaint, the listing was quietly edited to include “noise potential,” which was not visible in my booking view – clear manipulation. Airbnb support has been a nightmare: I provided video proof, screenshots, and detailed explanations – yet I was asked the same questions over and over, forced to repeat myself, and pushed to cancel my own booking without any written guarantee of a refund. I refused to be tricked into giving up my rights. On top of that, I couldn’t even access the apartment for the first 3 days due to severe flooding and a cyclone – roads were closed, Ubers canceled. I was forced to find emergency accommodation. Airbnb showed no understanding. I am exhausted, financially at risk, and emotionally drained. I am still waiting for justice and a refund. No guest should go through this. Airbnb has failed to take responsibility – and the way they treat guests is shameful.

1. Unannounced and severe noise disturbance:
The listing described the accommodation as peaceful. It explicitly stated “No Parties,” and there was no warning about increased noise levels or it being a “student accommodation.”
In reality, a roughly 50-year-old flatmate was constantly present in the shared living area, playing loud TV and music for hours — often until 3:00 AM, and starting again around 8:00 AM. Sleep was impossible.
This situation was not disclosed in the original listing and only added later (“Noise Potential”) — which I can clearly prove with timestamped screenshots.

2. Airbnb’s massive failure and contradictory handling:
I reached out to Airbnb support multiple times and submitted substantial evidence (including a video recording of the noise, screenshots, and a full written timeline).
Despite that, I was repeatedly ignored, pressured, and not given any clear confirmation. They advised me to cancel the booking myself — without any written assurance of a refund. This is unacceptable, especially since I am clearly entitled to a refund due to the defects in service.

3. Natural disaster – property was inaccessible for 3 days:
For the first three days of my booking, I was unable to even access the property. A cyclone and heavy flooding hit the area. Roads were officially declared impassable, and my Uber driver could not get through.
I had to book an emergency accommodation, which I can prove via receipts, news articles, and Uber logs.
This makes it clear that I paid for a service that could not be used, through no fault of my own.

When the property you rent is described as stunning (stunning Bath town house, Walcott buildings Bath UK)  and you arrive and find it dirty, untidy, smelling damp, unsafe stair carpet and broken items like blinds and chair legs. You contact hosts immediately who do absolutely nothing to resolve and then air bnb remove your bad review which you post to warn others as it ‘doesn’t fit with there rules’ leaves you feeling not heard. I would not recommend them and I will not use them again ever! "
2025-03-24,3,Airbnb lost its soul,"I’ve used airbnb for many years as a guest in different countries. I was also a host for a few years. 
Mostly it’s been great, good opportuniites to stay cheaper than hotels and in areas less touristic. Also getting to know people I’d never met otherwhise. A few problems has occured but I can handle that.

Recently I’ve had a few issues with bookings and with login and contacted the support team. It’s not been easy and it’s taken a long time to resolve, with messages and phone calls, sometimes confusing what the issue actually is, to some call center in perhaps Bangla Desh or somewhere around there. They’re doing their best I suppose. 
 I just feel airbnb and the idea of what airbnb were standing up for is really unfortunately lost. 
I do still book rooms through airbnb anyway, because I can usually find cheap places and occationally have valuable encounters with hosts… "
2025-03-24,2,Airbnb is a joke ,"I have been an Airbnb person for the last three years. I recently Airbnbed out a property of mine in Florida. Let me tell you about the kind of people that came to stay at my place two strippers that got high the entire time and then had the audacity to say they felt like they were being watched and harassed and people don’t like it when the host bothers them. Well, she parked in the main driveway and was asked to relocate her car and that apparently made her feel unsafe and like she had no privacy. Or how about the construction workers that said they had four when my Airbnb specifically said it fits two comfortably or 4 if you’re in a pinch and then they brought eight people who disrupted my tenants tore up my yard and broke all my stuff. But Airbnb didn’t care about that. Although I did get the $20 back for the broken curtain rod, but not the four additional people two additional trucks and all the other damage. or how about the old people that came took all of the lighting fixtures off the walls and said I needed more lighting and rated me a two on cleanliness because they didn’t have a washer and dryer and felt that it needed to be updated. It needed to be updated. You had a stove and oven and everything that you need to live there except a washer and dryer. Let’s not forget the pictures and the square footage are all in the listing. On top of that, guests we’re paying two to $300 more for their taxes and fees and then guests are getting mad at me saying I’m expensive. I unlisted my property after only three months, two drug baggies (different guests) and two people who lied about who was staying. It gives people like me who travel and don’t wanna stay at a hotel, a bad rep. 
As far as staying at an Airbnb, I have stayed at five different locations. The first one was wonderful, but other guests have ruined it so it’s not listed anymore. One of them was nothing like the pictures and the other one had a host that actually lived upstairs and came to visit several times. (Not ok) i’m not a huge fan. I think I’ll stay with the hotels."

The card I used for payment is now defunct - I want the refund to go to the default card on my Airbnb account. I spent 15 minutes on the phone just now being told the same thing again and again - no one 'able' to complete this simple and reasonable task which people must ask for daily. I will avoid using Airbnb in future.

If Joe Gebbia is not immediately dropped as a chairman of the company and publicly ousted as he should be, I am leaving AirBnB. 

I love AirBnB, but this is supposed to be a company that celebrates cultural diversity, exploration and building connections, not a company that helps an authoritarian president ruin the currently longest-running and second-biggest Democracy in the world. 

I don't care that Joe Gebbia is apparently doing this ""in a personal capacity"" as communicated by AirBnB. The lines between personal, political and business are now blurred because Trump made them blurred. By accepting huge payments from billionaires, selling Teslas from the White House lawn, or making the yearly Egg Roll a business-funded event, just to name a few examples. "

2025-03-23,1,I’ve been an Airbnb user,"
I’ve been an Airbnb user, but after my recent experience, I cannot recommend this platform. I encountered a false and retaliatory review from a host, which clearly violated Airbnb’s Review Policy. Despite providing clear evidence (chat logs, time-stamped photos, and message history), Airbnb’s support team ignored my case, sent me generic responses, and refused to properly review my evidence.

For over a week, I have been passed between multiple support agents, each directing me to the same form and sending the same links, without actually addressing my concerns. The complete refusal to allow a simple 5-minute call has wasted my time and theirs.

It’s clear that Airbnb does not take guest concerns seriously and prioritizes automated responses over real customer support. If you encounter a serious issue, be prepared for zero accountability, endless back-and-forth, and no resolution.

Airbnb needs to do better—ignoring valid concerns and dismissing customers is not the way to run a trusted platform."

I had an incident where I charged a renter $25 to give to my cleaner because the cleaner made a separate trip out to my condo (25 min each way) when my guests couldn’t find the bath towels. The bath towels were exactly where I told her they would be and where any person with common sense would think to look to find them (under the bathroom sink next to the shower). The renter was mad and wrote me a bad review. I tried to get Airbnb to take it off for the reason of her being retaliatory. Airbnb wouldn’t remove the review. The renter went so far as to google stock me, found out the name of my business, which has nothing to do with Airbnb and wrote a fake One star review for my business. Yet somehow, Airbnb doesn’t think she’s retaliating. I have three listings with Airbnb, 285 reviews, of which 99% of them are excellent and I’ve been with them for nine years. The renter has one other review besides mine and has been with them for less than a year. However, Airbnb makes more money off the renters than the hosts. I will be looking for another platform."
2025-03-22,1,Very poor show and disregard from AirBnB from a guest perspective.,"Beware of fraudulent Hosts. Beware of AirBnB's tone of voice and stance (in my experience) regarding fraudulent Host damage claims lodged against the guest. Stayed for a few nights in an apartment in Milton Keynes with its own private underground parking. On arrival the apartment was in a sub standard condition with black marks on walls, scratch on TV screen, loose plug outlet. Loads of defects. Took pictures but due to busy schedule didn't have time to report or insist on a change of apartment. Some 3 hours or so after vacating the host falsely accuses me of damage and supplies similar pictures and submits a claim via AirBnB claims for £300. So we now have a strong case of misrepresentation as the advert showed a pristine apartment and a strong case of false accusation. Then ensued a lengthy back and forth via email with AirBnB in me proving my innocence. The fact I had pictures and could prove when these where taken could leave no doubt of the false accusations. Interesting fact is that AirBnB paid the Host from their own insurance and told me that was due to my fantastic record with them over 9 years, but I need to read the guest terms again. So in my experience a very poor show and disregard from AirBnB from a guest perspective. Oh and just over a month later I received a car park fine for displaying a photocopied permit, which was provided by the host. Appealed and the fine was cancelled. So BEWARE there are some fraudulent people out there and as a guest AirBnB do not have your back. I have consequently deleted my AirBnB account. Never again. He who laughs last laughs the longest. Adios."

When I’m calling from a uk number and completed my stay in the UK tbh the least I’d expect is someone to speak fluent English. There systems are awful and it seems they can’t see refunds or any previous cases that have happened.

However over the years I’ve noticed that the Airbnb service fee plus the cleaning fee has become disproportionate. I’ve just looked to book a week and the Airbnb charges on top of the price of the accommodation adds an additional thousand pounds, it’s just not cost-effective anymore. I think Airbnb have become greedy and they will price themselves out of the market. i’ve previously queried the cleaning fee with some hosts as their accommodations standard of cleanliness didn’t warrant an excessive cleaning fee, only to discover that the host doesn’t even get the cleaning fee."

2025-03-20,1,Unfair Account Suspension – Airbnb Ignoring a Crime Victim!,"I have been a loyal Airbnb user, but I am extremely disappointed with how Airbnb has treated me after I was the victim of a violent crime in one of their rentals.

During the first week of March, 2025, I was drugged and robbed inside an Airbnb in Medellín, Colombia. Criminals used scopolamine (a dangerous drug) to incapacitate me, then stole my phones, wallet, and thousands of euros in valuables. I followed all the proper procedures:
✔️ Filed a police report immediately
✔️ Reported the incident to Airbnb
✔️ Provided all supporting evidence, including security footage and building security failures

Instead of helping me, Airbnb permanently suspended my account, blaming me for the crime I suffered. They wrongly classified my case as a violation of their policies, despite me being the victim, not the perpetrator.

I appealed the decision, explaining that:

I was not aware that the criminals were involved with drugs.
I never participated in or facilitated any illegal activity—I was the target of a premeditated robbery.
The building security failed, allowing the criminals to leave unescorted, which was out of my control.
Despite all this, Airbnb refused to reconsider and closed my account permanently without a valid reason. They have ignored my request for a fair review and left me without access to my account, even though I did nothing wrong.

🚨 Is this how Airbnb treats crime victims? Instead of supporting their guests, they punish them? 🚨

I demand that Airbnb’s executive team reviews my case properly. I won’t stop escalating this issue until I receive a fair resolution.

@AirbnbHelp – Please respond publicly and resolve this case. I will update this review based on how Airbnb handles this situation."
2025-03-20,1,Airbnb Failed This Mother & Baby – A Frustrating and Unfair Experience,"I’m extremely disappointed with Airbnb’s handling of serious host concerns. While they eventually covered the £1,000 worth of damage caused by my guest, the process was incredibly frustrating. I provided clear video evidence before and after their stay, including footage of a leak into my baby’s bedroom on day two. Despite this, getting Airbnb to take action was stressful and time-consuming.  

To make matters worse, the guest left a retaliatory 1-star review after refusing to pay. Airbnb uses AI to automatically reject review removal requests, making it nearly impossible to challenge unfair feedback. My reputation, which I built over four years as a dedicated host, is now in tatters because of a system that prioritizes automated decisions over fairness.  

Although I was eventually reimbursed, the lack of immediate support, the unfair review system, and the difficulty of navigating Airbnb’s claims process have made it clear that hosts are not properly protected. I have since removed my property from the platform, as I no longer trust Airbnb to value or support its hosts.  "
2025-03-20,1,Airbnb allows their hosts to…,"Airbnb allows their hosts to discriminate against potential renters by giving them 24 hours to look over your account and decide if they want to rent to you based on your last name and picture.  In 2025 this should be illegal.  If the room is available on the calendar,  I should be able to book it.  Unfortunately,  this is the second time it has happened with airbnb and they are defending the host's right to pick and choose who they would like to rent to. "

I am a host and had a 2.5 month stay booked. After 5 days the tenant demanded to leave because she had a psychological condition and couldn't handle the fact that the loft bedroom window was onto the rest of the apartment and not onto a street (which is typical for a loft property) She then made up an excuse of noise (no noise level measured) airbnb breached the Long-Term Strict Cancellation Policy and refunded her booking with no penalty even though I refused their request to cancel the booking. Their customer support is disgraceful. Long-Term Strict Cancellation Policy is MEANINGLESS. Use furnishedfinder and issue a lease instead for long term rentals."
2025-03-19,1,Host Referral is False Advertisement,I am very disappointed as I referred two new hosts and now airbnb is not keeping what they promise in their host referral promotion. They are trying to find all sorts of excuses not to pay the reward. I have been messaging with them for 2 months and every single customer support agent says a different explanation. Things that are not written in the terms and conditions at all. Really nasty treatment.
2025-03-18,1,Very poor and disappointing experience,"Very poor and disappointing experience. I used the messaging facility on the app to request more information about some holiday accommodation that we liked and never ever received a reply despite the rating for the accommodation saying that a response is usually received within an hour. It also became apparent that Airbnb also add an enormous amount extra on top of the actual accommodation rental costs. The breakdown of costs said that a £190 discount had been applied but when we looked at the breakdown and final cost, Airbnb had added about £200 on top for using their service(effectively a booking fee) In the end we booked somewhere else instead using another holiday provider and their commission/booing fee for exactly the same time period (14 nights) was just £49.00 as opposed to the hefty £200 that Airbnb had wanted to charge us. Difficult to see why anyone would book using Airbnb when there are so many other reputable holiday providers available that are easy to contact and have good user friendly websites and good telephone customer support teams.

My accommodation was broken into during the night, and I was robbed—losing my passport and winter coat. This left me stranded in Toronto for six extra days, forced to pay for emergency travel documents, new flights, and additional accommodation, all due to Airbnb’s failure to ensure a safe rental environment.
To make matters worse, the host refused to help—he wouldn’t even call the police and completely ignored my follow-ups. Airbnb’s response has been just as disappointing. Despite reporting this serious security failure, they denied my refund request and are offering only a fraction of the compensation I need through a limited reimbursement process. This does not cover my stolen items, my extended stay, or the financial and emotional distress I endured.
Airbnb claims to prioritize guest safety, but when I needed real support, they failed me. If you’re booking through Airbnb, think twice—because if something goes wrong, you might be on your own."

2025-03-18,1,Avoid at All Costs – Host Harassment & Airbnb’s Failure to Act,"I had an absolutely terrible experience with this listing - (Castle Terrace, Entire home in Arraiolos, Portugal, Hosted by João.) The host was extremely rude, arrogant, and harassing, sending me inappropriate messages that were completely unacceptable. To make matters worse, after my stay, they left a revenge review full of false claims.

I reached out to Airbnb customer support (Confirmation Code: HMDQ9DDNBR) expecting them to uphold their policies against harassment, but they did absolutely nothing to help. Despite clear evidence of the host’s behavior, Airbnb refused to remove the unfair review or take action against the host.

This experience has shown me that Airbnb does not protect guests from abusive hosts and allows unfair, retaliatory reviews to remain on profiles. If you value your peace of mind and safety, AVOID THIS LISTING AND THINK TWICE BEFORE TRUSTING AIRBNB SUPPORT."
2025-03-18,5,Great Experiences Every Time,"I honestly don’t understand why Airbnb gets so many bad reviews. I’ve been using it for years, and every time I’ve had an issue, customer support responded quickly and resolved it without any hassle. The booking process is smooth, and I always find a place that feels comfortable and welcoming. For me, Airbnb has been a reliable way to find great accommodations, and I’ll keep using it without hesitation!"
2025-03-18,1,Airbnb customer service is TRASH,"Airbnb customer service is TRASH!  I have been an Airbnb host for about 8 years and have been a ""Superhost"" the entire time so I get a dedicated line to call when I have issues.  However, since the company became a publicly traded company the customer service has gone to shit.  It is a fight EVERY TIME I call to have an issue resolved.  Today the customer service rep refused to let me speak to a manager so today is the day I give up hosting on Airbnb.  The money I make from it isn't worth the headache of dealing with the company"
2025-03-17,1,Beware! Safety issues with unvetted Airbnb hosts.,Beware!! Don’t use Airbnb. They recently cancelled my Paris accommodation for four nights for my family of five without any notice or detail. I had to contact Airbnb to determine the issue to which they stated there were safety concerns with my planned accommodation!!! This information took over three times contacting the company. The customer service centre seems to be based out of India as the communication both written and oral was very poor and difficult to understand.  No resolution has been offered to date.  I now have no accommodation for my trip coming up which is difficult to find for a party my size.  There are now less places available and prices have shot up.  From my experience I have learned there is a lack of security and safety standards for guests . My cancellation was as a result of a prior guests experience unfortunately. I will never stay at Airbnb after this scary experience. You cannot rely on them to assist you.

On a positive note April with Airbnb went out of her way to make sure that we had alternatives to the rental property and was instrumental in obtaining a credit voucher for the alternative rental property and the difference in price will be refunded to us as per their refund guidelines.

Thank you again April for your help with this matter.
Thank you. Don and Sheri Thompson "
2025-03-16,1,Please consider booking through other channels,"I have a short term rental and AirBnB has made up 70% of my bookings. At some point in late 2024, the bookings stopped. I am now nearing the summer when my unit is usually very booked in advance, but I have only bookings from VRBO and Booking.com and I am only 30% booked.
There is nothing wrong with my listing, no complaints, high reviews, free cancellation, and my prices are lower than comparable units. Yet, my unit is not showing up in search results and AirBnB is not helping me find out why. This issue, which seems arbitrary and algorithm related, could force me to sell which is likely to lead to a big loss of tens of thousands of dollars. I am pleading with them now to let me talk to a manager to help dig into what is happening with their search algorithms and they seem unconcerned.
AirBnB takes high fees, has no protection for hosts, and yet expects us to keep using their platform. I am already using other channels and they just don't have the same volume of guests coming through. I implore potential guests to look at other ways to book - try VRBO, Booking.com, Google... There's a lot of options, let's diversify so we don't end up maintaining this monopoly."
2025-03-16,1,Account Suspended after attacked in…,"Account Suspended after attacked in Airbnb.

I was literally sitting in an Airbnb rental when the door was kicked in by a drug addict and I was attacked.  I effectively defended myself using a kitchen knife.

Police arrested the drug addict and concluded that it was a proper self defense.  I was released within two hours, only to have Airbnb permanently close my account due to 'safety reasons'.

Not only that but they cancelled all my reservations from all my guests for my own home, even though the attack took place in a totally different country and had nothing to do with the listed home.

I literally sued and they settled out of court for $4k.  They refused to unsuspend the account but said I could open another, so I did.

About a month later, without talking to me or explaining, they instantly tossed my guests out again, calling them at 2am and demanding that they leave, then suspended the second account also."
2025-03-16,1,I want to share the worst experience…,"I want to share the worst experience I’ve ever had with Airbnb. Renting an Airbnb in Brazil turned out to be my biggest mistake.
Being human, I offered shelter to a friend at 4 AM, someone who was not included in my booking. My host, who constantly monitors his camera, saw this and took issue with it. The very next day, without even giving us 12 hours to pack, we were told to leave immediately for violating the policy of having a fourth guest not listed in the contract.
To make matters worse, the refund we received was only 30% of the total amount, despite the host previously stating it would be 50%. And Airbnb, acting as an intermediary, did nothing to help. Even squatters are given 48 hours to find accommodation, yet as paying guests, we were treated like criminals and thrown out onto the street.
Simply put, Airbnb has the worst customer service imaginable, and I regret ever using their platform."
2025-03-16,1,The property was not as nice as in the…,"The property was not as nice as in the photos - pretty dingy. We couldn't bear to stay there even one night, so left and stayed in a hotel. The owner refunded some money but this is my first and last Airbnb experience - be warned that review inflation is rife and there's no guarantee your property will be as described."
2025-03-15,1,BAD AIRBNB!,"BAD AIRBNB!

My host cancelled with less than 48 hours to go. This was nice house at Cudjoe Key, near Key West. We had airline tickets, and thousands of dollars of activities paid for, and my granddaughters were ready to go, so I had to find something else. Well, Key West is a super hot spot for Spring Break. Airbnb offered to help and then suggested three alternative rentals: one would have cost me an additional $15,000, one was $10,000 more, and the last one was a trailer--a trailer! So, I found and equivalent house. It was $3000 more, which is pretty amazing for Key West during Spring Break. Airbnb only gave me $873.52, so I was out of pocket $2214.13 to get the new rental. I told them that it wasn't fair and they should cover the full amount...but I would be happy splitting it with them. They refused. IN MY OPINION THAT IS NOT FAIR. I reserved an paid for a house...I should get one for the money I paid.

BAD AIRBNB!"
2025-03-15,1,Cancelled booking ,Booked though air bnb. 10 days before my holiday the host cancelled the booking. If you're looking for secure bookings air bnb isn't where it's at. 
2025-03-15,1,The platform is just annoying,"The platform is just annoying. From verification procedures to communication, everything about the platform is just frustrating. In my opinion, the entire platform is a complete failure. The only reason it is so widespread is simply that it was one of the first platforms of its kind. The customer service is terrible and doesn’t understand a word. Even the verification process alone takes a really long time. I am thoroughly and extremely dissatisfied with the entire platform."
2025-03-15,1,Deeply Disappointed by Airbnb’s Inflexibility During a Family Medical,"We booked an Airbnb on September 2, 2024, for a planned family vacation scheduled for July 12–19, 2025. Sadly, just two weeks after booking, my mother suffered a seizure and was diagnosed with a glioblastoma brain tumor—a devastating and aggressive condition.

While we initially hoped she’d still be able to make the trip after surgery and treatment, her condition worsened. My father canceled the reservation on February 24, 2025—well within the host’s posted policy, which stated cancellations made by July 5, 2025 would receive a 50% refund of nightly rates and cleaning fees.

Since we had only paid 50% of the total cost ($6,213.82), we expected a refund of that amount. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen.

The host, Tory, was unwilling to work with us. My father offered medical documentation—she declined. She originally said we’d receive a full refund, then later claimed she was unaware that Airbnb’s payment plan policy overrides her posted cancellation terms. Eventually, she said we’d only get a refund if she’s able to rebook the week—no guarantee, just a conditional promise.

We were then told by Airbnb that because we used a payment plan, we were not eligible for any refund, despite canceling well in advance and within the stated policy window.

I spent over two hours on the phone with a kind and empathetic customer service manager, who admitted our situation warranted a refund. But he ultimately said he couldn’t issue one due to internal policy restrictions.

This experience revealed a serious flaw in Airbnb’s system: there is no clear, compassionate process for families dealing with real emergencies—even when the host’s terms suggest otherwise.

Instead of support, we were met with rigid policies, conflicting information, and a host who changed her story. We’re not asking for special treatment—just basic fairness and human decency. Airbnb failed us when we needed compassion the most.

I’ve reached out directly to Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky in hopes that he’ll step in and do the right thing for our family.

2025-03-14,1,Review Not Being Removed Despite Providing Evidence,"The support team confirmed that the review could be removed, but due to a technical issue, they were unable to process it at that time. For days, I have been explaining that I have evidence proving the review is unfair and that a support agent has already acknowledged this. However, the review still has not been removed.

According to the new policy, only a team called the ""Special Team"" can handle such cases. However, there is no direct way to contact them. They only provide a form link, and despite submitting it multiple times and informing them about it, I keep receiving the same generic response. It seems like everyone is repeating the same scripted replies, and it is impossible to find someone who genuinely takes responsibility for the issue. If you are treated unfairly, you are simply left to deal with it, with no real solution in sight."
2025-03-14,1,AIR BNB Beware,"I am a faithful AIRBNB customer.  In general, it works.  However, I had a host cancel 2 days before a reservation was due to start, putting me in a tremendous bind and cost in me $700 additional dollars to get the only remaining property that met my needs.  I cannot review the host, and while AIRBNB states that it will “cost the host”, that have no consideration for the person who has been cancelled.  I managed to wrangle a small amount of compensation from AIRBNB, but there is not nearly enough protection for renters.  They had the use of my money for that reservation for a full year and cancelled with impunity.  Beware!!"
2025-03-14,1,Think before hosting-I've been a host with them for over…,"I've been a host with them for over five years now, and I've definitely learned a lot along the way! One thing I’ve noticed is that the focus often seems to be on the guests. 

For instance, there was a situation where a pump broke down due to unforeseen circumstances, and the guidelines they have—what they call ""community standards""—were used to navigate that challenge. I had a guest who decided to take off his trousers and insisted on staying, even when I needed to assess the situation because of a burst pipe caused by the dry season. Although Airbnb offered him the option to relocate, he felt there wasn't enough communication from their side.

In the end, I made the decision to cancel his reservation, which I felt was the right choice. 

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first bump in the road I've faced. During Covid, I had a guest who left quite a mess, and while I received only $80 in compensation, I was faced with potential repercussions myself. Sometimes it feels like the fees can be quite high as well!

Overall, while there have been challenges, I still find hosting to be a rewarding experience!"
2025-03-14,1,Website glitch left us minus £400,"Airbnb website glitched and closed our payment deadline 2 days early - this meant we lost half of our payment and the booking was cancelled. Contacted customer support and was told it was up to me to sort it with the host, even though it was airbnb's error. Host refused to refund or rebook us, so theres £400 down the drain. Never using Airbnb again - booking.com is better."
2025-03-14,1,OMG I had NO IDEA AirBnB was so bad!,"OMG 
HOW I wish SOMEBODY would create another VERSION of AirBnB that was STRICTLY based HERE  with U S employees!!! I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with 2 people in call centers in some 3rd world country with next to NO command of the English language trying to explain that I needed to change the form of payment for an 8-MONTH reservation that starts in 2 weeks. 

Between the times I was on hold and the times I was TRYING to decipher what the first guy, and then his female supervisor were saying after I explained the situation to then SEVEN TIMES, I could've rented an RV and just lived in THAT for the 8 months!

Then lo and behold I come here to Trustpilot, where I ALWAYS verify my gut feelings about any company I'm dishing out more than 5 bucks to, and find their average review here is LOWER than 2 outa 5 ?!?!?!?

I should've come here FIRST!!"
2025-03-14,1,TERRIBLE!,"TERRIBLE!! Airbnb let's hosts hide additional fees in sections of their website that are only visible after the booking. HOW TO GET INSIDE is such a place.

Although you book via Airbnb therefore your contract is with them, they hold no responsibility for false advertising, they do not provide a refund and confuse you in a web of multiple conflicting communication to make you give up. I recommend booking.com or Agoda.com for a professional service. Greed is driving Airbnb. And do complain to your credit card companies and small claims court as it’s the only way Airbnb will start to care."
2025-03-13,1,They don't stick to their own Terms of Service,A letting company used Airbnb to rent their property. Novasol asked me for more than the agreed cleaning fee after I paid on Airbnb by sending me over to their own lettings website where they asked for a bank transfer before arrival. This goes against Airbnb's Terms of Service but Airbnb wouldn't return all of my money due to the deceitful host's cancellation policy.
2025-03-13,2,Loss of super hosting status due to not selling more than 10 trips a year despite 5*. Madness!,"Well well I knew they were not popular in certain quarters but these ratings says it all. I am writing as a host though I have used them many times as a guest too. 
Airbnb look after themselves and only themselves! Sound familiar? Sure I’ve heard that in the news about someone else recently 🤣. They have recently removed our super host rating for no good reason. 
Their thinking is that now we have dropped from 4 to one property with only a summer season to let ( ie 12 weeks or so) we do not meet their silly criteria anymore whereby one must rent more than 10 visits (1 day or 2 weeks makes no odds) per year. Our Villa is sold out all summer mostly by Airbnb but many bookings are 2 or 3 weeks so we don’t meet their target! 5* or not, (we actually had 5* on all our properties until we sold them short while ago) we no longer qualify. How crazy is that? Won’t be with them for much longer me thinks, especially in view of these customer ratings it looks like there is little point anyway. Shame, was once a good company. "
2025-03-13,1,All the reviews are true,"All the reviews are true. Airbnb user for more than 10 years and i have constantly been in a position where Airbnb side with the host. It is not fair and have even been provided false information by Airbnb staff that had benefited hosts. I urge you to lower your usage of this app and find alternatives. Very bad business practises and extremely unethical company. Customer service is non-existent, and if i could give a 0 rated score i would! Shameful and despicable service.  Airbnb are alienating their customer base and i have started to move away from this app! Stick to booking.com or other alternatives."

Will never use Airbnb again, and I would recommend noone else does either, bunch of criminals.

edit 20/03/25 - I am still waiting on a refund from airbnb it has now been almost a month since they supposedly processed my refund and yet nothing has come from them, they say the issue has been escalated and an engineer is looking into the problems but getting nothing from them, at this point I'm not expecting to ever see this refund, complete and utter bunch of criminals."

2025-03-12,1,Can’t believe they’re still in business!,"We were traveling for our anniversary. It was discovered that the house we were staying in had a roof leak, soaking our mattress and both beds had bugs in them! We, two size grown adults, were attempting to sleep on a couch covering with a bath towel because we didn’t want to use their linens (bed bugs). We were communicating with host, then at 11 pm contacted ABB, they said they’d get back to us within an hour. At midnight I sent ABB a message that we’re going to pack up and start driving across the island (in a third world country), making our way to a more touristy area to find a place but was hoping we heard from them prior to know the plan and because of spotty service. No word from ABB. At 1:30 am I called ABB and they said they’d “escalate the situation”. In the meantime we had people knocking on our window as we drove, didn’t want to roll the window down, also didn’t want to make them mad. Couldn’t just “drive away” as we had to drive slower than we could walk because of the DEEP pot holes in the narrow roads. We didn’t end up hearing back from ABB until the next morning. We ended up sleeping in our car, in a parking lot, in a third world country. They never did assist us in finding a different place. We did find one for our last night. We have been hosts for ABB for 3 years, 5 star super hosts with lots of reviews. I can’t believe they would leave any human stranded like that! How are they in business???? "

I'm hoping for the days of registered b and bs to come back. These guys are getting worse, causing homelessness was bad enough.
I am not one for expecting others to be responsible for when things in my life go wrong. Equally, I am responsible and considerate to others, especially business owners. I had two more breaks booked for this week. However,my phone went missing on Sunday. Due to the snowball effect of this, and I have learnt a pricey lesson...do not get over dependent on your phone, I cancelled one booking and got half back. The second place,I decided to reschedule the booking for a longer stay, really to give hosts more business for the inconvenience.This was a place where you could pay a deposit then the full amount. 
However, Airbnb demanded the full amount straight away. I explained my situation,but they wouldn't have any of it. Just a sickly apology. This was after needing to get past a stupid virtual assistant. What they do is get you to write a message,then a virtual assistant gives a completely unrelated response. Then you have to write another message. I then got a message saying that they had tried to ring my lost phone. It would be a great world if you could still use your lost phone. Are we on planet Zog???
In the end I had to do a cancellation, making me 70quid out of pocket for this one . OK,yes, what happened to me is not anyone else's problem, but seriously,would I have paid just short if one hundred quid on Saturday to intentionally lose it the next day. Come on. I then got a series of repeat messages not making any sense. The final straw was, quote, 'I hope this finds you well'.... passive aggressive smug arrogance. Why don't these organisations drop the disingenuous figures of speech???
Needless to say, after the final booking I have in April,I won't be using them ever again. Also,their fees are absurd. You get charged cleaning fees when no cleaning is done. Like most of these free Enterprise companies now, there are just the few who benefit. I'm not being chippy, Id rather have little but have a moral compass.
Don't tell me they will ask me to contact them on social media. This is breaking data protection,where's the privacy here?"

2025-03-11,1,Airbnb Treats Hosts Unfairly – Zero Transparency,"Airbnb’s handling of experience removals is completely unacceptable. My experience was deleted without warning, without explanation, and without any chance to fix whatever so-called issue they claim exists—even though it had great reviews and followed all Airbnb guidelines.

When I asked for details, I got a copy-paste response with zero useful information. Meanwhile, similar experiences remain live on the platform, which makes this decision feel biased and unfair. It’s beyond frustrating to see Airbnb prioritize certain hosts while shutting down others without justification.

As a small business, we rely on platforms like Airbnb to connect with travelers, and their lack of transparency and total disregard for hosts' efforts is disgraceful. If they can remove a well-established experience overnight, who’s next?"
2025-03-11,1,Just don't,"Just don't.  Our reservation was cancelled for no reason.  We are trying to get our $5,000 back and will wait the 72 hours for a credit, like they stated.

It was our first time with AIRBNB and our last.  AS I said, JUST DON'T"
2025-03-10,1,Lack of humanity in it's business model,"It seems like the Airbnb customer service team has zero motivation to genuinely resolve issues and rather their main goal is to diffuse or sweep issues under the rug.

Most of the owners I've dealt with recently have been money hungry and complained in a rude manner about having to clean a dish or 2 after my departure, there's no air of honorable hospitality or good faith that seems to be coming from this company. 

I can see how the world will move back to using the hotel industry more as hotels are set up for a hospitable stay that serves the guest.

Airbnb could have been successful had they maintained people friendly values but that's gone out the window.."
2025-03-09,1,Awful experience ,"Awful experience following and a disappointing stay. 

Arrived at accommodation after a 3 hour drive to find the shower not working due to the head being dirty, the shower was electric and the switch was wired incorrectly as you needed to turn it to stop for hot water and then the cold setting to turn it off. 

The Tv and remote didn’t work either which was also reported.

The host came out and cleaned the shower but text to explain they couldn’t sort the tv until the last day which was too late and with having 3 kids this wasn’t great. The host claimed everything was fixed and I provided proof it wasn’t but they offended me by saying the favoured the host. 

In addition I sent evidence of units which should have be fixed to walls as they were very unstable and light weight with one falling over and cutting my daughters eye plus a shower curtain which was a tension bar and also very unsafe. 

If your stay is fine then all is good but if you have an issue then don’t expect them to both reading your evidence as they will only ever favour the host. 

Will not use again!!!"
2025-03-09,1,Review policies...,"As a long-term SuperHost with consistently high ratings, I expected Airbnb to uphold its own policies when handling guest disputes. Unfortunately, this experience has made it clear that Airbnb prioritizes guests over loyal hosts—no matter how unfair or dishonest the situation is.

I received a 1-star review from a guest who was polite and happy until I filed a reimbursement request, as Airbnb itself recommends hosts do. After this, the guest’s tone completely changed—they falsely accused me of racism and even implied they would steal from my apartment. Despite providing clear evidence that this review was written out of retaliation, Airbnb refused to remove it, violating their own Review Policy.

To make matters worse, customer support was abysmal:

I was called for only one second, and when I called back, no one answered.
Every response was copy-pasted and dismissive, ignoring my actual concerns.
My case was closed repeatedly without any real engagement with the facts.
The first thing people see on Airbnb is a host’s review score, so this one malicious, false review has damaged my status as a SuperHost. Airbnb should protect experienced hosts who follow the rules, not punish them for doing what Airbnb itself recommends.

If you’re a host considering Airbnb, be aware: they will not protect you. If a guest decides to leave a false, defamatory review out of revenge, Airbnb will do nothing about it.

Airbnb needs to start enforcing its own policies fairly and stop stonewalling dedicated hosts who are the backbone of their platform."
2025-03-09,1,Unprofessional assistance for safety issues,"Airbnb claims that their safety policy is a priority. The reality is that when an unfortunate incident occurs, Airbnb's support is very superficial in understanding the issue accurately and providing effective assistance. If something serious happens, you are completely left on your own."
2025-03-08,1,Terrible host experience!,"I’ve been a dedicated Airbnb host for years, maintaining a five-star rating and receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback. Unfortunately, my entire listing was suspended after just a few less-than-perfect reviews—even though one of them contained inaccurate information that misrepresented my service. I filed a formal complaint, but Airbnb’s support channels have not addressed my concerns fairly.

This sudden suspension has had a huge impact on my livelihood. It’s disheartening to see how one or two outlier reviews can override a long history of excellent hosting. Even worse, the current policy seems to place all weight on a guest’s perception, without balancing it against objective performance metrics or verified evidence of a host’s consistent quality.

I’ve asked Airbnb to review my case thoroughly, but the lack of transparency and slow response have been extremely frustrating. Despite my loyalty and proven track record, it feels like Airbnb disregarded my side of the story and took action that doesn’t reflect my overall performance.

If you’re a host who relies on Airbnb for income, beware: a few disputed reviews might be all it takes to jeopardize your listing—even if you’ve worked tirelessly to keep guests happy. I sincerely hope Airbnb improves its review policies and offers more balanced, transparent resolutions for dedicated hosts like me.
"
2025-03-08,1,Don’t trust reviews,"Not to be trusted, you put in a complaint and it goes nowhere. I’m not sure who they’re protecting the host or their customer. I even produced pictures and nothing was done about it. They closed the case out.

2025-03-08,1,"Unfair, biased dispute process against false damage charges ","We recently had a terrible experience with Airbnb, where we were wrongfully charged $368.86 for alleged damages after our stay. Despite having no proof that we caused the damage, Airbnb automatically sided with the host and attempted to charge our credit card without our consent.

Why This Is Unfair:
	1.	No proof of damage: We repeatedly asked for time-stamped photos or other conclusive evidence that we caused the alleged damage, but Airbnb failed to provide anything substantial.
	2.	We already paid $2,228 for our 3-night stay at a rate higher than the market price – This included a $140 cleaning fee, yet Airbnb still attempted to charge us an additional $100 for “extra cleaning.” This seems like an unfair way to double-charge guests.
	3.	Zero fair dispute process – Airbnb’s dispute system is one-sided. Guests are held liable without real evidence, and once Airbnb makes a decision, there is no proper way to appeal or escalate the case.
	4.	Stressful, biased & unethical practices – Airbnb clearly favors the hosts over guests throughout the process. This experience has caused significant emotional and physical stress as we have been forced to fight an unfair charge instead of enjoying our trip. Airbnb’s handling of this has made us question their customer service and trustworthiness.

Beware Before Booking on Airbnb!
	•	If a host falsely claims damage, Airbnb may automatically charge you without proof.
	•	Even if you dispute it, Airbnb’s system is stacked against guests.
	•	Their customer service offers no real recourse—once they decide, they ignore guest complaints.

We will not use Airbnb again unless they change their policies to protect guests from false or unfair charges. If you’re considering booking, be aware that you could be held liable for damages without evidence or a fair process to defend yourself.

We strongly urge Airbnb to:
✔ Stop charging guests without sufficient proof.
✔ Revise their dispute process to allow fair appeals.
✔ Provide better transparency in damage claims.

If you’re reading this, think twice before booking on Airbnb! They prioritize hosts over guests, even when the claims are unfair."

I made a reservation in August 2024 and sent a message in February 2025 to the host with a question. I received no response so I called the number on the listing. The host said they had no idea why it was listed on Airbnb. I called customer service and they made a few phones calls and cancelled my reservation. The hotels in the area are now 3 times more expensive than when I booked and all Airbnbs are booked. Airbnb didn’t care and didn’t offer me anything to try to compensate. That was shocking to me. They blamed the host and took no responsibility. It is a terrible way to treat customers. "

Terrible, argumentative staff jerked me around for 4 hours while they were completely unable to solve the problem.  I just made a full-week reservation for over $10K 3 days ago that went through without a hitch, so clearly my ID has been verified.

I blocked off several days a week ago and have had to block them again 2 more times because the system opened the days! Their system also changed my cancellation policy! I only now took a screen shot of the blocked days so we will see if the system changes it yet again!
2025-03-06,1,THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"If I could give the less than zero I would. I was unfortunate to encounter a very rude host by the name of Guliver Apartments. Where I realized I was about to get scammed into an unfavourable property I cancelled the order. 
Thereafter this host spent a week sending me all sorts of insults, harassment a d threats 
I reported this to customer service several times and they tried to sweep it under the rug and even closed the ticket I opened without so much as a call. It's been 3 days now and Airbnb have done nothing to resolve this whilst the host still keeps sending me harassing messages and indignant insults.
Disgusting and shocking. I wonder if AIRbnb is this nonchalant about complaints or is it just cause of my geo.

Airports have shut, flights have been cancelled, there is a government-issued request to not travel, all businesses are shut. Yet according to Airbnb this doesn't meet the requirements of their Major Disruptive Events Policy. These people are absolute crooks. All of us affected by this are boycotting Airbnb here on in."

Went to place a booking for 3 guests. ""Unauthorised Party"" was flagging when attempting to make any reservation. Even tried to book for 1 guest and still flagged as unauthorised party. Messaged the host directly to be told she had no problem with me staying and I was provided a link to book as I have stayed before. still didn't have this random restriction lifted from my account making me look flakey as opposed to the app. 
Created a new account to honour my promise only for the malicious AI to detect that I already had another account. still couldn't book unauthorised party!!. I then Raised a case through their support only to be told to not create a new account rather than addressing the actual issue. New hosts missing out on bookings because of AI behaviour thinking I'm trying to organise a rave. Shouldn't the host be given the option to accept a potential booking if I've messaged them to clarify that it's ok on their end to book again + with 3 guests? I had tried to reserve another flat earlier in the week however nobody responded to my request but this was completely overlooked by their software.
Support then clarified that ""weekend last minute bookings"" constitutes a party even though I tried to book flats earlier in the week but nobody got back to me and my booking were cancelled. it's a 3 bedroom flat to house 3 people? Do not think this is very fair on the hosts completely unaware people are trying to book their apartments. The AI should inform the host, not make the decision for them. "

The Landlord, was an absolute nightmare, & actually threatened me, by insisting I move out, because he didn,t like what I was saying about his apartment! The bed was horribly uncomfortable, I could feel the mattress springs pressing against my back! I spoke to about 15 people @ Airbnb about the problem, & each time I spoke to a different person, & had to go over the whole story over & over again !They also wanted proof about what I was saying! The landlord was trying to damage control by saying there were no fleas! why then was my body covered in bites, & did I have to see a pharmacist to get hydrocortisone cream, & antihistamine tablets?The whole stay, was a complete nightmare!The Landlord @ one point threatened to come to the apartment, & evict me despite still having a contract with me that he refused to cancel!2 days after I left, the apartment was being advrtised again on Airbnb!?!! What are the consequences for his threatening behaviiour? I was travelling alone, so single female traveller 68 years old, being threatened by an Airbnb Landlord. I felt very unsafe! Have never been treated by any previous host in this manner. Do not have anything to do with a Landlord named Alan Quinn. (He now advertises, using a company name!)"

So I called customer service and the girl could not speak English very well. So after 35 minutes I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. She told me it was against company policy to transfer me since I was not verified!! I said that’s why I’m calling but I cannot understand you and you obviously cannot understand me since you keep asking me the same questions. I’ve given up with this company. There are plenty of other rental sites.
2025-03-05,1,Beware before booking with Airbnb.,"Beware before booking with Airbnb.
After not using them for 2 years, I booked a night in Austin last night. I booked an airstream camper. First it said it was in Austin. It was not. It was 25 miles from Austin. Second there were I think 5 campers and the photo in the listing was nothing like my camper. The door was wide open when I arrived almost 3 hours after check in. When I went inside it smelled like urine and what I guess were suppused to be beds were unmade stacks of foam. It was gross. Chickens running around, we're in Texas out in the country and you leave the door wide open? Long story short airbnb resolves it and refunds me. Then they encourage me to try again and give me a $50 coupon. Great!
Ok. So I try again tonite.  Things got strange pretty quickly. The host sent me a questionnaire asking me if I had partys, would sign an agreement not to have party's and my reason for being in Austin. Yes. They sent this THREE times. After the third time I told them perhaps we should just cancel cause i've answered you 3 times and you seem uncomfortable. Then they say there is a $300 deposit or $35 waiver fee. Why wasn't this charge or offered when Ipaid for my booking??? The after 4 hours of waiting they say they can't confirm until I pay the waiver fee. THEN SEND ME TO ANOTHER SITE OFF OF AIRBNB TO COLLECT MONEY AND ASKED FOR MY ID. ID THAT HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY AIRBNB. 
I calle airbnb to cancel at 1pm today to tell them how upset I was consideing what happened last night. First, she told me never to put personal information on an outside site. She said someone was on it and would get back to me. I wait until 5pm and no call. Meanwhile the host calls. Again I sent the host a message through airbnb that Iwas cancelling. have had 4 calls with airbnb today and the host. The last rep just told me that it is now Airbnb policy to allow the host to collect money from you after you have paid to book, on another site. This person asked me for my drivers license on another site. NOT COOL. Head uo folks, this is not good. I'm sure Iost the money but glad I didn't give my information to these people. It sure feels like a scam and I told airbnb just that. They say no scam. This is exactly what happend to me during that Amazon anydesk scam. Now I understand all the bad review for Airbnb. Another great thing gone bad due to sheer greed. Airbnb does not have your back.

2025-03-05,1,Airbnb is not recommended,Airbnb is not recommended. I had very negative experiences in 2 of the 3 properties I paid for. The last property was unacceptable & I lost nearly $400 on a place I had no intention of using. I will only use Airbnb if I am able to view properties before paying. It's just too risky compared to hotel & motel stays.
2025-03-05,1,Disgusting customer support,"Airbnb’s customer service is an absolute disgrace. They are completely unresponsive, ignoring my case for over a month while refusing to address my legitimate refund request. However, when it comes to falsely charging guests for damages without any solid proof, they act instantly.

They were trying to wrongfully charge me $350 for so-called “damages” with zero real evidence—just close-up photos that don’t even prove where or when the issue happened. Airbnb didn’t provide any valid invoices or repair receipts, yet they still sided with the host, showing a complete lack of fairness.

Meanwhile, my valid refund claim for a broken bathtub and a missing workspace—both clearly misrepresented in the listing—has been completely ignored for over a month. I’ve contacted Airbnb multiple times, and all I get are empty promises that someone will “reach out soon.” No one ever does. They simply close my support tickets without resolving anything.

Airbnb has proven to be a dishonest platform that prioritizes hosts over guests, even when the hosts are clearly in the wrong. Their customer service is utterly useless, and their so-called “dispute resolution process” is a joke.

I will make sure to warn as many people as possible about their shady practices."

Complete waste of time "
2025-03-05,1,"Avoid Airbnb – Unreliable, Costly, and a Complete Disaster","I used Airbnb six times in the last two months, and on three separate occasions, I was left stranded because the host either didn’t respond or failed to provide access to the property. This resulted in enormous last-minute costs for me, completely defeating the purpose of using Airbnb in the first place.

The worst experience was on New Year’s Eve in Paris. I arrived at my Airbnb and attempted to contact the host numerous times, receiving no response. I was left standing outside in -4°C for hours, desperately trying to find alternative accommodation. Given that it was one of the busiest nights of the year, every hotel was either fully booked or outrageously expensive. It wasn’t until nearly 1 AM—five hours later—that I finally found a single room available, which cost me €300 more than my original Airbnb booking. The next day, the host finally responded, casually explaining that she had moved apartments and no longer lived at the address. How was this listing still active? How is Airbnb not verifying that their hosts still own or have access to the properties they advertise? They charge enormous fees—what exactly are they for if not basic verification?

The second and third failures happened within 24 hours of each other.
On one occasion, I arrived at the Airbnb at the designated check-in time, called and messaged the host repeatedly, and received no response for hours. I was forced to book a last-minute hotel late at night. Later, I found out the host had been sick and “fell asleep.” While frustrating, at least it was an explanation.

However, the next night was even worse. I had booked a hotel through Airbnb, which had a 24-hour reception, so I assumed nothing could possibly go wrong. How wrong I was. After traveling across the city in a taxi, I arrived at the hotel to find a tiny sign on the door stating: “Closed for one month for renovations.” I had made the booking almost exactly one month prior—meaning Airbnb had allowed me to pay in full for a completely shut-down hotel. How does that even happen?

Each time, Airbnb refunded what I had originally paid, but that did nothing to cover the hundreds of euros in additional costs I incurred. I booked through Airbnb to try and save money, but in the end, it cost me far more than if I had just booked hotels directly.

I will be uninstalling Airbnb and never using it again. My advice? Use Booking.com or any other platform. I’ve never had issues with them, and after this absolute disaster, I wouldn’t trust Airbnb with a single cent."

We have raised issues with host and were faced with harrasment over messages, to the point that I had to turn volume on my phone- I was bombarded with messages late into the night, even when I have asked her to stop and told her I was dealing with AirBnB support. Howere, the support seems to be for the host only - as a guest you are completely ignored, even after raising safety issues. Messages from the support team were also hostile, demanding additional payments, even though we've paid in full!! We are still waiting for a refund as we've only stayed 2 out of 5 nights ( no property heating or hot water during Feb in Wales). And if your review is honest they just remove it.

2025-03-01,1,Jonas Host for Bossa de Botafogo| Rio de Janeiro ,"Details of this Airbnb is an apartment hosted by Jonas and co-host Brenno in Botafogo Rio de Janeiro, Brazil!

Beware of where you stay this host was very rude and violated community guidelines by not giving me the code for the apartment at least 2 days prior and Airbnb let him get away with it!

The host only allows for POSITIVE reviews on his profile!

I wrote a fair review and he got Airbnb to remove it, I then tried to get my review reinstated and they told me I was being manipulative and coercive and violating community guidelines, which is completely untrue and they kept it deleted! 

This is my fair review:

The apartment was decent but it had lots of problems, But mainly the host was the issue, very unhelpful and causes a lot of stress. Will refuse to give code to the apartment until he wants you to have it and not 12 hours before like Airbnb states. Very inflexible, so if you need something please contact Airbnb instead of them. And honestly rude. The shower drains has worms constantly crawling out while you have a shower. A bad smell as you enter the lobby, and although the apartment was clean, the pillows smelled awful. We had to wash them ourselves. Along with lack of ceiling fans ( they are there but don’t work.) sockets unfinished, right side of aircon unit broken. And no green space at all ( as stated in the listing) along with a smell from kitchen drain. I’ve noticed he has denied and sent hateful messages to other people who left a bad review without addressing any of the issues stated. So if anyone has questions please reach out. We have photo and video evidence.

We talked with our property and her story for cancellation was a complete lie ! We were booked in a large room as we had 7 in our party.  They only offered a credit of our funds to rebook.

2025-02-24,1,If I could give no stars I would,"If I could give no stars I would, we booked the stylish and luxurious 2 bed flat in Knightsbridge ran by the company Carl’s place. My sister booked this apartment for a couples' weekend to celebrate my 35th birthday. While our stay itself was pleasant, as we spent most of our time out attending a West End show, our experience has since been completely overshadowed by an unjustified £2,000 damage charge imposed on us a week after departure.

The property owner contacted us more than a week later, claiming we had broken the refrigerator because it was no longer staying cold. However, we did not use any of the apartment’s amenities apart from the shower in the morning, as we dined out for every meal and never once opened the fridge. We also checked out well before the designated departure time and left the apartment in immaculate condition.

It is deeply disappointing that this company is attempting to hold us financially responsible for an issue we had no involvement in. This experience has completely eroded our trust, and we will not be using this company again. What should have been a memorable and special weekend has turned into a distressing ordeal. I strongly advise others to avoid this property to prevent a similar experience.

We have also since tried to contact the owner to which we have had no response whatsoever it is also impossible to leave any kind of review on their Airbnb page. Air BnB have been no help themselves either. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"

2025-02-24,1,Terrible Customer Support & Misleading Policies – Wasted My Time,"I had an extremely frustrating experience with Airbnb due to hidden fees and completely useless customer support.

The host required a separate damage deposit outside of Airbnb, which was not clearly presented during booking. When I arrived, I was denied check-in unless I paid this additional fee—something that was never included in my initial payment. If this fee was truly mandatory, it should have been included upfront, not buried in the listing details.

I contacted Airbnb in advance expecting help. Instead, I wasted two full days messaging their support team, speaking to different agents, and even receiving a phone call—only to be told repeatedly: “This is not our problem.” If Airbnb was never going to help me, why did they let me waste so much time?

At the very least, Airbnb should enforce transparency in pricing and make sure that hosts do not require payments outside the platform. Instead, they refuse to take responsibility and leave guests completely stranded. After this experience, I can no longer trust Airbnb, and I will reconsider using their platform in the future.
"
2025-02-24,1,Deception & Sloth.,"AirBnB clearly state that cancellations within a given time are fully refunded.

That is a LIE. There is a deduction. The deduction is made with no explanation. 

Also, why is it with all the technology we have nowadays, AirBnB take up to 8 days to pay the refund. 

When a booking is made the money is transferred immediately, so why can it not be transferred back into customers accounts with the same speed,

Is it perhaps something to do with making interest on the money?

Not impressed at all."

Also, I'm selling my property and so I wanted to let some guests know in advance so they have time to find other accommodation, they won't let me cancel and give them notice for the benefit of the booking but will allow me to wait until my sell completes and buyer has less notice. Fine by me, I will soon have sales documents, but was thinking in interest of the guest to have more notice. "

It was disgusting. Before moving out, the owner confirmed with me - through Airbnb messaging - that they agreed to a full refund. So I left. But now, after I moved out, they refuse the refund.

Airbnb support will ALWAYS side with hosts. They ask for evidence and after seeing that creates every single lame excuse to not compensate guests.

- host clearly has broken amenities and I didn’t get anything because I reported it after 72H

- host said in writing she will give me full refund past the cancellation policy and f me over. Airbnb did nothing

- support is based in Philippines which means you’re dealing with robotic and unhelpful agents making nothing as a living wage.

Airbnb is not regulated nor does it belong to either Atol or Abta therefore I am stuck with some plane tickets but no property to go to. I spent weeks calling airbn and having to repeat what had happened to a different operator every time but my complaint never led me anywhere.

I got as far as submitting all my details again ( even though they already had them) and my credit card details, but then they wanted proof of identity. OK. It's a corrupt world now. Found some ID and got ready to upload it. But then, even though I'm working on a laptop on the website, they demand I use a smart phone to scan a QR code. I don't have a smart phone with scanning capability. I have a scanner and a laptop. But no. Two hours, multiple messages and a long frustrating phone call to airbnb later - the best they could suggest is that I get a friend to help me scan the QR code using a smart phone.

When they blocked my calender, they also blocked my wife's Booking com calender because the two were linked. This I consider to be illegal since it interfered with another person's business

2025-02-17,1,won't be using Airbnb again,"My colleagues and I had a very disappointing experience with Airbnb, and as a result, all of us made the decision to discontinue using their services. What happened was that their vendor (apartment owner) had cancelled at the last moment (late in the evening), and it was too late to book another unit. So we contacted Airbnb and gave their staff an opportunity to find a replacement property. This was not done (due to late hour); and instead we were expressly told by Airbnb representative to go to a hotel. It was clearly discussed that it’s a more expensive option because we needed at least three rooms. This was clearly understood -- and we proceeded to do as instructed.

Subsequently, very surprisingly, Airbnb refused to reimburse the costs that we had to endure associated with the three hotel rooms (in excess of the original budget, per the cost of the apartment I had contracted from Airbnb). I became aware that Airbnb collected $50 as penalty from the reneging owner/vendor. Strangely, however, Airbnb didn't even offer that amount towards my unplanned costs that night (caused by the breach/cancellation). Needless to say, this is dishonest/unacceptable, so we’ll not work with Airbnb in the future. Fortunately, alternatives do exist."

Attempts to contact customer support have been met with generic responses, offering no real insight into the reasons behind this decision. As a long-time user, I find this treatment unacceptable. Airbnb’s approach in this matter reflects a disregard for its users and raises serious concerns about their commitment to fairness and customer service.

I lost service on my flight and then the next day when I had service, I went to look at the Airbnb and realized it was not the location I wanted. In California, it says you have 24 hours to cancel as long as the booking was 72 hours before (which mine was). I was on the phone with Airbnb and they told me they had to look into the California laws I shared with them and they would call me back in 2 hours. Airbnb then told me I wouldn’t get a refund because it was 27 hours, which was outside of that policy. I tired to reach out the host of the new place and they told me they would only refund me if someone else booked. It was just over three days away and I do not expect someone to book it. The customer service was BEYOND horrible and I will never ever use Airbnb again. Please share this story as warning to not use Airbnb. "

2025-02-13,1,From a landlord perspective.,"From a landlord perspective.

There's a lot on here from guests who've had bad experiences, but wanted to warn hosts too.

When AirBnb works, it's great - the review system generally keep both hosts and guests (I've been both) ""honest"", AKA reasonable.

But when something goes wrong...

I had a guest want to stay for several months.  She complained about WiFi and a few other things during her stay, not without justification.  So I was surprised a few weeks later when she booked another long-ish stay, and warned her that the Wi-Fi would still be problematic.

To cut a long and painful story short, she's effectively now squatting in my AirBnb (the long stays should have been a warning - why not an AST?), and AirBnb are precisely zero help.  They spent 5 days trying to contact her and she simply ignored them.  They say I've no right to make her leave even though there's safety issues (the wood-burning stove chimney is overdue its annual sweep).  She won't allow access to anyone, and keeps a key in the door to stop it being opened.

So to court I go.  This may have been the outcome even if AirBnb hadn't been obstructive, but not being permitted access or to evict under their rules?  They're always very friendly in the Rio de Janeiro call centre, but it's a useless system once something goes wrong.

2025-02-12,1,FUAIRBNB,"Where to start!  I reserved and paid half down for a rental on fox lake illinois around the end of December or first of January for a trip i was taking with my family to see my sons graduation from the Navy.  Then paid the rest at the end of January.    Then 6 days before my 6 family members and I fly out, which everything is paid for, even our Tickets and Rentals at Wilmont Mountain, I receive a message that my booking has been canceled by your system and my account has been deleted from airbnb with no explanation other than your system has some one that some how is tied to my name that flagged ur system and screwed my trip.  And I'm told a refund will be back in 7 to 15 days and that's just how it is, what I'm told so im just ******, Yalls words!  My question is WHY and how is it that your system that held my money for over a month and just screwed my trip up, didn't flag anything when I first booked the home, show my id and passport and use my card twice, which is not yet refunded but you take my money right away even before I get there and you delete my account through airbnb so i can't even track my refund because my account is removed.   THIS IS HOW YOUR COMPANY WORKS WITH THEIR TRAVELERS!!!!  So for all the people planning a trip and need to book a place to stay DEFINITELY DONT USE AIRBNB, THEIR A CORRUPT BUSINESS WHO MIGHT WANT TO DRAW SOME INTEREST FROM YOUR MONEY UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE AND SCREW UP AN IMPORTANT TRIP FOR YOU LIKE THIS ONE WAS FOR ME TO SEE MY SON GRADUATE FROM THE NAVY AND THEY WILL JUST SAY IT IS WHAT IT IS!!!!"

After our stay, I shared some feedback regarding certain deficiencies in the house and cleanliness issues. However, it seems that the host took offense and, in retaliation, wrote a false and baseless review on my profile, making an accusation she could not prove. In her comment, she claimed that I had drilled holes in the walls of the house.

I asked her to remove this false accusation, but she refused. The host in Espoo, named Leila, should be avoided at all costs. If you stay at her place, be prepared for her to take revenge on you for even the slightest criticism!

I contacted Airbnb’s support team, but they informed me that they could not help in this matter. Due to this false review on my profile, four different reservations I made for my winter trip were canceled by the hosts. When I asked for their reasoning, they stated that they were concerned about potential damage to their properties because of the false accusations in my profile.

Since Airbnb refused to assist me in any way, I decided to close my account and will never use their platform again."

That is known as a scam."

2025-02-07,1,Absolutely Disgusting Experience,"Absolutely Disgusting Experience – DO NOT USE AIRBNB!

Our family of four booked an Airbnb in Barcelona, and it has been an absolute disaster.

From the moment we arrived, the apartment was missing basic necessities like toilet paper and towels. When we contacted the host, he was slow to respond and rude. But things got even worse—we later discovered mold on the walls, which is a serious health hazard. When we brought this up with the host, his response was beyond unacceptable: he threatened to kick us out within two hours, at midnight, if we wanted a refund.

In desperation, we reached out to Airbnb over 15 times, through messages and calls. Every single time, they promised to get back to us. Not once did they follow up. We made it crystal clear that we were afraid of ending up on the street in the middle of the night, yet Airbnb completely ignored us.

And now, more than 24 hours later, we are still waiting for a solution. No help, no response, nothing. Airbnb’s customer service is an absolute joke—they do not care about their customers’ safety or well-being.

This has been an absolute disgrace—both the host and Airbnb have shown zero responsibility or basic human decency. If you’re considering using Airbnb, DON’T. They will abandon you when you need them most."

There aren't two bedrooms (one of the alleged bedroom is merely a bed cast in an open space without a door) and there aren't two ""full bathrooms"" (one of the alleged ""full bathrooms"" is a toilet with a sink). My comment on Airbnb was turned down because it didn't comply with the guidelines and I made a claim pursuant to the dispute resolution process defined by Airbnb that was rejected with good words, regrets and apologies by the Support Team. No compensation, no partial reimbursement, not even of a symbolic nature. What is particularly disturbing is the fact that Airbnb was unable or unwilling to correct the misleading ad. The scam therefore goes on, Airbnb knowingly encouraging it, in accordance with their guidelines of course..."

When I asked the woman about the assistance in covering the extra last minute cost difference, she said there was nothing they could do about it. After I had her reread the email from that morning, (which she stopped reading before she got to the part about the ""Air cover""  part, I probed her to look further in the email and read it and she never would read it aloud! When I read it to her, she stated, ""I'm sorry for the miscommunication but there's nothing I can do. The best I can offer is a $150 coupon towards a future stay."" I explained how that was putting us out over $500 that day and she just repeated the same statement, then said bye and hung up!

So I tried to phone.  The host phone number was wrong.   Finally managed to find the host listed on the airbnb website but he doesn’t own the apartment.    I received a refund from Airbnb but I have lost all my money on flights and trips we had planned

""You told us you'd rather cancel your reservation than finish the last step of checking that you're really you"". However, I did not cancel nor was I asked for any ID verification. When I contacted Airbnb, I was told ""the computer did it"".  When I escalated to a ""specialist"", I was told that Airbnb was having trouble with the host over unresolved safety issues. They recommended three alternative properties that were poorly located and hundreds of dollars more. When I complained,  they offered me $20 discount on a $584/night property.

All Airbnb did was send us two alternative options—both nowhere near the same quality. They then offered a maximum of two £30 vouchers, but only £11 was actually deducted when booking.

2025-02-02,1,I was  blocked   for NO   reason!,I was  blocked   for NO   reason!
2025-02-02,1,Record everything!,"This is as unbelievable as it is illegal and unnecessary. As a large corporation the childish petulance is astounding. Above all else from the below do not allow AirBNB to conduct any dispute by telephone, this is their preference for a reason! Any problems with them you need to have the information in black and white and all the chats captured. They insist on calling, every email is just a reference to a chat you have to log into, there is never any information provided out with their own system. There is actually terms in their emails warning not to divulge the information! They must believe they are above the law, maybe they are in some locations but not the UK!
AirBNBs host listed a room, I booked the room, then realised they had a better room so cancelled the first and rebooked the 2nd immediately.
Turns out neither room was actually available and the host offered a 3rd room at an inferior spec and wouldn’t cancel the original.
AirBNB would only refund to credit, meaning I would need to use their service instead of an actual refund fully supported by UK law and VISA chargeback!
This credit according to AirBNB cannot then be sent to my bank as they do not have that capability. Think about that for a second, they can use those funds to pay another unrelated host and their own commission but not give back to the original payee? And they expect people to believe this!
After 3 days of getting absolutely nowhere with AirBNB I filed a PayPal dispute, they refused to answer that as well, informing me I should only contact them! the arrogance was unbelievable. This went on for 3 days, air BNB saying only contact them whilst making it impossible to do that by closing the chats I had been using (luckily I had been screen recording so had proof).
Then when I informed them I have no intention of conversing direct as I need PayPal to record this they closed my account literally 2 minutes later, it was more like 90 seconds and gave me no way to retrieve my funds that were with AirBNB as AirBNB credit
People imagine large corporations don’t/aren’t allowed to lie, airBNB are behaving illegally. OK, I used Paypal and to be fair PayPal investigated and refunded me (1 month later). If I had just paid direct using VISA then a VISA chargeback would have been successful as well. Any other payment method? Good luck? This activity was absolutely 100% illegal. Unarguable. They locked me out of my own money and closed my account. No contact details no login details, absolutely nothing other than chargeback.
After I escalated with PayPal from dispute to claim I actually imagined that AirBNB knew they were wrong and would just accept it (since they would not respond to the dispute), they didn’t, they took my funds kept them with AirBNB as AirBNB credit, locked me out of that account so no access to those funds, didn’t respond to me or the PayPal dispute but then had the nerve to contest the PayPal claim! (I don’t have access to the info the provided but clearly it wasn’t sufficient!
AIRBNB I’M MORE THAN HAPPY FOR YOU TO CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS ASTONISHING AND CLEARLY ILLEGAL BEHAVIOUR!

2025-02-01,1,Airbnb has been disappointing,"Airbnb has been disappointing. The service is no longer safe for guests, especially when traveling with children. Recently, we had a very unpleasant experience: after checking out, the hosts falsely accused us of damaging property that we didn’t even touch and demanded money. We reached out to customer support, but they simply sided with the hosts, ignoring our explanation. It feels like guest protection on Airbnb is practically nonexistent — any host can make baseless claims, and you’re left with either paying or having your reputation harmed. Additionally, finding accommodation suitable for a family with a young child and a school-age kid is already difficult — the filters don’t work well, and the actual conditions often don’t match the description. Hidden fees also make bookings more expensive. In the end, we were left with a bad experience and are no longer sure if we want to use this service again."

I have used Airbnb for 9 years now. I recently had a very bad experience with a host and was given a partial refund from Airbnb as the host refused to refund anything. Although I thank them for this, what I find really concerning is that unless the host reviews me, my review won't be published. This is completely wrong! If a host has been bad, they will purposely not do a review so they're review won't be seen! I should have the right for my review to be seen! The property i stayed in was unsafe and I can't believe meets building safety standards, yet I can't advise potential new customers that should have honest reviews. I am so disappointed and surprised that Airbnb operate how they do. They have a responsibility for guests happiness and safety. Anyone who uses them, should have their review seen.
I had a place in Murapasa, host was Anna. She didnt warn us there was renovation work being don't and the noise and mess was awful. Because we complained, when we left the place in perfect order, she then tried to accused us of stealing our own amazon firestick! I was astonished! Bad people on Airbnb and they seem to get away with it when the guest can't leave their truthful review. Biased and dishonest people at Airbnb, so disappointed they can allow a building in such a poor state on their books. 'Renovation' work seems to have been going on at the place for years by past reviews.  Guests safety isn't important it seems

2025-01-31,1,Airbnb ILLEGAL in Thailand ,"Hi I'm an English solicitor (lawyer) based in Bangkok. I live in Condo Building and like 99% of the residents we own our homes.
Under Thai law (which is very strict) daily renting of homes is illegal under 30 days. To do Airbnb the host must apply for a hotel licence. Over the past few years Airbnb in our building has increased and causing misery and distress to the residents. We have formed a residents committee and are involving the police. 
Airbnb publicise an information sheet on Thailand which is wholly inadequate as it does not spell out that it is illegal here. What more is there to say? Guests should not book in Thailand, Airbnb are being irresponsible and putting profits before local laws. Let me repeat: Airbnb is illegal. Hosts of a condo unit cannot get a hotel licence as a condo is not a hotel.
This is our home and every day the residents have to do battle with Airbnb guests. What do Airbnb do? Nothing as they are happy making the profits. Why does Airbnb not check the Thai laws and ban the platform in Thailand unless a host (such as a hotelier) can produce their hotel licence. I doubt they will reply or it will be a template response: ""we will consider all your points seriously as we are aware of our online worldwide responsibilities "" which is double speak for "" get lost loser, we have money to make."" 
Please Airbnb do the right thing here adopt a different paradigm for Thailand before something seriously goes wrong as we are at breaking point. "

Firstly last year, I booked an apartment 5 months before going on holiday. Less than a month before we were going and the host cancelled. Prices for places had then shot up by hundreds of pounds. Airbnb didn't care and we have to fork out the money because the host cancelled on me.

Secondly my partner got scammed during a time of illness and sleep deprived. It was a gift card bought through Amazon which Airbnb couldn't cancel even though we got in contact within the hour. They stated the Amazon reference has no link to them and that Airbnb is not the seller of the gift cards on Amazon which it clearly says the seller is Airbnb. They can't put you through to any other department let alone the first time I spoke over the phone it sounded like a party, couldn't hear my name 5 times and got my phone number wrong constantly. They want want to avoid any conversation unless it's kept to the same script. Signing off every message with ""Rest assured your experience is our priority"" is an insult.

There is a reason they never respond to any views on Airbnb. Never use them again."

2025-01-30,1,⚠️ ⚠️  Beware of Airbnb Host Scams,"

Airbnb abandoned us after a host’s fraudulent damage claim.

We had a terrible experience with an Airbnb in Malaga, Spain(December 2024). The host falsely accused my 14yo of breaking the shower drain, causing a leak in the downstairs apartment. However, the neighbors confirmed this was an ongoing issue that had never been fixed!

We provided Airbnb with proof, but they sided with the host and tried to charge us €863 in damages. On top of that, we had to book an expensive last-minute hotel (€896) since the apartment was unlivable!

Airbnb’s lack of support left us stranded in a foreign country on Christmas eve, dealing with an angry neighbor and a dishonest host. We wouldn’t wish this stress on anyone!

⚠️ Think twice before booking on Airbnb—if anything goes wrong, they will take the host’s side, even in clear cases of fraud! ⚠️ Unethical and irresponsible"

As a student studying abroad in Europe, I want to experience Europe fully and travel on my weekends. Three times now, I've tried to book with Airbnb with large and small groups. Every time I try to book, I'm given the message that I am a ""party risk"" and cannot book. I've switched to using VRBO and have had no issues booking and have a 5-star rating as a guest. These issues come with no prior Airbnb experience. I've never booked with them before and have no history with them as a guest, yet they won't even give me the chance to book.  After numerous phone calls across many numerous weeks and numerous emails sent back and forth, they maintain their stance on not letting me book.

   My post included pictures with facts, to protect other upcoming guests from items listed, that are NOT in apartment. To prevent them from getting scammed by electricity charges, not mentioned on Airbnb listing or via checkin host.
   I reported items not provided or listed by Airbnb by host and damaged as an act of good faith. You don't know, unless we tell you. Property own
ers and host may also not be aware unless informed. You can't fix what you don't know. 
   Now, my name is destroyed. Host's faticious and derogatory post was refused to be removed by Airbnb and I can NOT comment on my review or that of host. Which gives the assumption the host was correct, when it was a concoction of lies and deceit to protect her, without providing facts, factual proof or data.
   I was also told by another Airbnb representative, that voice recordings were stored in a back office and unaccessible, and were unable to be used as digital voice recordings to verify my claims. Aren't these mutual recordings to protect me as well????
    My stay at 231 Brakkeput Abou was traumatic and terrified me and my 3 animals. 6 days later, they're still hiding and these animals trust me with their lives!

6 days after I checked out and reported listing as not being 100% accurate, it still stands in it's original form. Nothing has been done to remedy the situation or to make 231 Brakkeput Abou's listing factual, they're still inaccurate. Which in the US, is considered false advertising. 
   Host, Marijolein, I highly suspect, is also posting under superhost's profile. Which includes same wording and writing style as Marijolein. Isn't this identity theft or false representation?
   How is any of this legal and why was I told I would be protected due doing the right thing, yet, my name is now mud? My name and my reputation is ALL I HAVE!!! And now is destroyed from trying to protect your future guests from this property.

There is lost amount and I spent a lot of time with them to figure out it and still not resolved. I talked to many of them every one starts from zero with me and waist a lot of time. 
Im still suffering from ignorance and no any clarification where is the missing payments. "
2025-01-27,1,Airbnb refusing to delete my account and personal data,I wish to delete my Airbnb account and for it to remove all my data. It is refusing to do so unless I provide it with further personal data. This is despite the legal requirement under Article 18 for it to delete all data if its client requests it. This company is getting out of hand. I decided to leave because recently tried to book a UK cottage (I’m a Uk citizen and resident) it required far more personal information and data than other Uk websites do
2025-01-27,1,"Disappointing is how I can describe my dealings with the platform, AirBnB. ","I've been running a holiday business in Greece for twenty years; villas in olive groves with expansive sea and mountain views. Peace and tranquility. As much estate bottled extra virgin olive oil as you can consume. Mine is a legal business: tax paying, tourist authority and chamber of conference registered. I'm a five star host, but why is AirBnB so difficult to work with? Let me have a look at the platform reviews on Trustpilot I thought, out of interest. The answer is, AirBnB get 1.3 stars out of 5. Not good. Reading the reviews, I am disappointed, disillusioned even, although I can understand and directly relate to how the platform works only in the interest of the platform itself, uniformly (seemingly) against the interests of both hosts and guests. It's a difficult business, demanding skill, knowledge and investment, something that AirBnB simply don't seem to understand or bother with. Currently AirBnB is a titan like Uber and Amazon, sweeping everything else aside. Unpopular titans don't tend to last unless they learn, change, understand and appreciate their business beyond simply profit margins. This is something hosts understand very well. It's been difficult and not very satisfactory, my period on the AirBnB platform. There's too much reliance on AI it seems, too much faceless, nameless automation; no personal service, no attention to detail. They strongly encourage reviews of hosts and guests; hypocritically calling this a community and yet they don't like, don't encourage, don't react to or respond to constructive feedback themselves, not of the platform AirBnB. Disappointing is how I can describe my dealings with the platform, AirBnB. "
2025-01-27,1,The most terrible customer service,"The flat was absolutely disgusting! It was not cleaned after the previous customers. Beds were as the previous customer left them after sleeping, bins full of rubish, bathroom with hair/stickers inside the bathtab, lounge in a mess with dirty towels lying around. Clearly, cleaners did not turn before we arrived. Moreover, beds in the bedroom upstairs had cushions covered with towels, which looked like someone before us was clearly not happy with the cleaniness of the place. The host was unreachable by messages and calls. I got in touch with the customer service and they were unhelpful for two hours claiming that they are following their procedure, then I have requested a call from the supervisor to wait another hour before moving the situation forward. After 3h of phone calls with the b&b customer service, we were told  that we can cancel the booking and will be issued a refund + 20%, which is not enough to find a place on Saturday at 6pm in London. We had no option on Saturday evening having arrangements and appointments for the evening, but stay in the place in the disgusting flat, absolutely owful experience, which I don't wish anyone. Once I re-booked it, the host answered straightaway and promised to clean the place, which had never happened! Sleeping in a dirty flat is not what you want to experience! I will never book via airb&b again!"

2025-01-27,1,Airbnb not compensating costs when host cancels booking 1-hour before check-in - disgusting service,"We had a booking for 5 people (one 5-months pregnant) in Bath. Our host then WhatsApp messages me an hour before check-in to let us know the reservation has been cancelled.

We then have to scramble to find new accommodation with very little help from Airbnb and finally we book the cheapest option they send which is applicable to our party size. This new accommodation is almost double the price of our original accommodation. 

Due to their ‘policy’ they offer us a 20% discount, but the discount is taken from the original accommodation cost, so it doesn’t even begin to cover the new accommodation costs. We have to book as it’s now 3pm and, as said, we’re panicking due to having someone pregnant in the group. 

In total we’ve had to pay £176 out of our pockets due to Airbnb’s host cancelling on us, which they will not pay us back for in compensation. I’m then offered a €100 voucher by one staff member, only to be pushed to a more senior member who can only offer $50?! Just complete mess with different currencies and their lack of care to even attempt to cover the full cost. 

It’s disgusting the lack of care they have for customers. I’m actually stunned I’m having to fight for compensation when we were the ones who were inconvenienced. Avoid using them at all costs! "
2025-01-27,1,Airbnb’s Poor Support and Unsafe Property Experience,"I had an extremely disappointing experience with Airbnb that has left me frustrated and concerned. During my stay at a property booked through Airbnb, a large tree branch fell and damaged my car due to the host's lack of property maintenance. The situation was not just inconvenient—it was dangerous. The branch fell in a high-traffic area where children were present, and it could have caused serious harm if it had landed on someone.

I immediately reported the incident to both the host and Airbnb, providing photos and evidence of additional hazardous branches on the property. The host dismissed the issue, refused to take responsibility, and did nothing to ensure safety for future guests.

I reached out to Airbnb for support, but the process has been nothing short of a nightmare. My claim was passed between “specialized teams” more than a dozen times, with over 100 messages and several phone calls. Despite assurances that I would be reimbursed, my claim disappeared from their system, and I have yet to receive a resolution months later. It is 5 months later and Airbnb still failed to respond to my case whatsoever! 

This lack of accountability and poor customer service is unacceptable. Airbnb not only failed to address a clear safety hazard but also neglected to follow through on their promise to resolve the matter.

I want to warn others about Airbnb’s inability to handle serious issues effectively. If you encounter problems, don’t expect them to take responsibility or prioritize your safety."

The host admitted that smoking was taking place within an area of the premises, yet sees no problem with advertising the property as non-smoking and that they cannot smell it. 
I moved out the next day and Airbnb were very helpful in the process. I use Airbnb a lot and it’s comforting to know that they have a process for handling situations like this.  "
2025-01-26,1,Airbnb cancelled my booking after taking payment twice,"I booked a cottage in the Cotswolds for a couple of night in May, booking process was so complicated having to supply driving licence, photo and prove ID etc.  I paid in full and was told I would get confirmation email.  I went to bed at 10.30pm, at 11.15 I was sent an email asking me to confirm my ID again but didn’t see it due to sleeping.  At 3.15am I received an email cancelling the booking due to not proving ID and a further email informing me that I would receive a refund.  The following morning I signed in to their app which asked me to confirm my ID, again, where they confirmed they accepted me to make a booking but then took another payment in full for the cancelled booking.  After many emails and phone calls they finally accepted that they had taken a payment twice after I sent them a copy of the transactions on my bank account but informed me it could take up to 15 business days for the refund.  I finally got the refund after a week!!!! If you are running a business that covers many countries you have to adapt the that country’s times not give deadlines for 3.15am to be answered by.  Also I understand that the hosts do not receive a penny until guests check into their properties so Airbnb are sitting on all that money in the meantime earning them interest on top of their fees.  Will never use them again, just wish I had read the reviews first!!!"

2025-01-25,1,Do not trust the ““support”” and their policy ,"I have been on the platform for over 5 years and for the first time I needed support. I arrived at the property and it was visible different to the photos, very dirty inside and outside of the rented room. The bath was impossible to use and my partner and I needed to go to a gym to be able to shower for the whole stay. After speaking with the host as soon as we arrived, and getting a very vague answer I contacted support within 24 hours and I felt even more unsupported, they could not understand properly what was my issue even if it was said on the phone and over message. After asking for a manager all the messages sent (at random times) were requesting an action giving me a limited time to answer, which made me feel even less cared. They offered to refund the cleaning fee and made it clear that I needed to be glad that they were doing that. After I sent a message where I made it obvious that I wasn't happy they just closed my case. 
I am not looking for money, just my rights! "

2025-01-23,1,Horrible Experience – Safety Concerns Ignored and Poor Customer Support,"I’ve been a loyal Airbnb user for over 8 years, but this last trip was the final straw that led me to close my account. My family’s vacation turned into a stressful ordeal, primarily because the host’s property was far from child-safe.
	•	Unsafe Furniture: None of the furniture was secured to the walls. When my 1-year-old tried to open a drawer, the whole piece nearly toppled over and actually fell on her once. We had to keep constant watch to prevent any further accidents.
	•	Injury from Pool Card: To make matters worse, a metal clip attached to the swimming pool access card ended up striking my 1-year-old’s eye, leaving it bruised. We were extremely concerned about potential vision damage.
	•	Host’s False Damage Claims: The host accused us of damaging the apartment and demanded money, yet never provided any proof. I refused to pay and raised these serious safety concerns with Airbnb.
	•	Airbnb’s Lack of Support: Despite my clear evidence of safety issues, Airbnb took the host’s side, showed no real concern for our family’s well-being, and ultimately did nothing to address the situation. The host even posted a negative review on my profile, and Airbnb refused to remove it—demonstrating they care more about profits than about prioritizing guests’ safety and peace of mind.

Given these experiences, I can’t, in good conscience, continue using Airbnb. Our family’s safety should be paramount, but it became evident that was not Airbnb’s priority. I’ve chosen to delete my profile and will never book through Airbnb again. If you’re traveling with children—or value proper customer support—think twice before relying on this platform."

Terrible service when we were trying to do the right thing and be reasonable, but ended up with dirty clothes/towels from the cleanup; clothes that we couldn't even wash due to the broken washing machine.

She even leaked our DM's, but it is just clear to show how AirBnB will do anything to kiss up to the people who rent out their homes using their website/app. Deleted my account, and I will be returning to hotels again.

2025-01-20,1,Beware: Hosts can claim you damaged something that you did not and Airbnb sides with them.,"Beware: Hosts can claim you damaged something that you did not and Airbnb sides with them.

My wife and I have used Airbnb for over 10 years in at least 6 different countries and never had a problem with hosts claiming damage against us. That changed with our latest stay. A wooden chair at the rental had its leg snapped off clean, but when we got there the chair was propped up on the broken leg to look as if it was undamaged (which is dangerous!). My wife sat on the chair and of course the leg didn't hold. My wife messaged the host and sent a picture of the chair and leg within an hour of our arrival at the unit so we'd have documentation that it was already broken. The host seemed understanding so we set the chair aside for the rest of the stay and didn't think much more of it.

Fast forward to the end of the stay a week later and the host says they're leaving us a 5 star review, and does. We leave them a 4 star review and then, after our review, the hosts claim with Airbnb that we broke the chair and asked for $1400 to replace it. We of course disputed it citing how the chair was found broken within an hour of our arrival but Airbnb sided with the host for some reason. We went through all appeals and Airbnb still sided with the host! We were so upset. We kept calling and disputing and asking to speak with someone, but they kept saying they would have to call us back. One time we couldn't answer the phone and later they said they closed our ticket because we didn't answer the phone. My wife and I both work full time with 3 small children (one baby). It was so stressful to have to deal with this after coming back from an international vacation and it has left a really bad impression with me."

These host can never be hotels. They're lazy, laid back, greedy, they want to do very little for a lot of money. AirBnB sees it and refuses to listen.

2025-01-18,1,Airbnb’s Neglect for Customer Service and Host Accountability,"I feel compelled to share my recent disappointing experience with Airbnb, a platform I once trusted for its fairness, principles, and customer service. During an incredibly difficult time in my life—caring for my father at MD Anderson—Airbnb not only failed to support me but exacerbated an already stressful situation.
Here’s what happened:
I stayed at a property that was less than satisfactory, with issues ranging from a persistent odor to non-working internet and TV apps, and an uncomfortable bed that forced me to sleep on the couch. Despite this, I remained polite and accommodating. I mistakenly believed I booked for two nights but rushed out early the next morning due to an urgent phone call I received, unintentionally leaving behind my blanket and pillow.
I contacted the host, Raul, through the Airbnb app, and we were in communication trying to arrange a time to meet so I could retrieve my belongings while I was still in town. I even offered to accommodate his schedule. However, he eventually began ignoring my messages and later falsely claimed that I had provided the wrong contact number, despite the fact that we had been communicating through the Airbnb app. I verified with Airbnb that my contact number was correct. Despite his negligence in communication, he refused to meet or return my property unless I provided a prepaid shipping label.

When I turned to Airbnb for help, I was shocked by the lack of empathy and the procedural runaround I received. Despite my documentation proving the host ignored me and even read my messages in the app, Airbnb sided with the host, hiding behind policies and expecting me to pay to retrieve my belongings. Adding insult to injury, Airbnb closed my case while I was sleeping, giving me less than six hours to respond.
This experience raised several disturbing questions:
Where is Airbnb’s commitment to fairness and accountability?
What is the purpose of customer service if it chooses not to serve?
Why does Airbnb support hosts who act dishonorably and fail to meet basic professional standards?
This isn’t just about a blanket—it’s about principles. I went out of my way to communicate and accommodate, yet both the host and Airbnb failed me at every turn. The policies Airbnb clings to seem designed to protect hosts while leaving guests helpless, even when the evidence clearly supports the guest’s case.
To Airbnb: your handling of this situation was not just unprofessional; it was unconscionable. Your lack of compassion and refusal to address clear negligence is a betrayal of the trust guests place in your platform.
To everyone reading this: if you value fairness, customer service, and accountability, I urge you to think twice before trusting Airbnb with your travel needs. My experience shows that when things go wrong, you may find yourself unheard, unsupported, and stuck with the consequences of others’ negligence.
This is not just my story—it’s a warning. I will continue sharing my experience to ensure others are aware of how Airbnb handles situations like this. Fairness and decency should never be optional.

2025-01-18,1,My Worst Experience on Airbnb,"My Worst Experience on Airbnb

Unfortunately, this has been the worst place I’ve ever rented through Airbnb, and what makes it even worse is that Airbnb enabled this situation by allowing the host to rob me despite my status as a frequent user of the platform.

The host, Lacy, proved to be an unprofessional, aggressive, and rude person. She seemed unable to handle constructive criticism and reacted inappropriately to my observations about the condition of the property.

From the start, Lacy insisted incessantly on showing me the place in person and at night, even after I explained that I had just completed an exhausting 20-hour drive. According to her, it was essential to be present to hand over the keys, stating: “I NEED TO BE THERE TO SHOW IT TO YOU.” This situation felt extreme and invasive, as I’ve never been forced to meet a host face-to-face in all my years of using Airbnb. After receiving seven persistent messages, I had no choice but to comply, as she made it clear I would not be allowed to access the property without her supervision.

The next morning, I woke up to discover the property’s true condition:
	•	The entire place was filthy and covered in mold.
	•	There were no smoke detectors.
	•	The kitchen utensils were rusty and moldy, which I documented with photos.
	•	The furniture was also covered in mold, causing an allergic reaction in my daughter.
	•	Basic appliances like a TV or microwave were missing.
	•	The floors were damp, creating a hazard for anyone walking on them.
	•	The staircase handrail was loose and unsafe.
	•	The door handles were so old they fell off, and some doors wouldn’t even close properly.
	•	The house was infested with spiders, and I found dead flies on the floor.

In addition to the property’s appalling condition, Lacy has proven herself to be a pathological liar. She claims that the house is “historic,” which is false, and I have evidence to prove it. She also insists that she has rented this property before, yet this is a blatant lie. My review is the first on this property, and when I found it listed, the house was marked as new on the platform, something I can also prove.

After spending just one night in this place, I filed a complaint with Airbnb, hoping they would address this unacceptable situation. Instead, I was met with disappointment. Airbnb not only allowed Lacy to manipulate the situation but also permitted her to charge me for three nights, even though I could only endure one in this old, unsafe, and neglected house.

Lacy even went as far as to clean part of the visible mold in a kitchen cabinet and used a knife to poke small holes in the wood to claim, both to me and Airbnb, that it wasn’t mold but structural damage. My photos clearly show it was mold before her interference, and I have documented proof of her actions. On top of that, she sent me threatening messages, implying that I would not “destroy her business.” Airbnb failed to act on this evidence or take my concerns seriously.

As a frequent user of Airbnb, I am deeply disappointed and disheartened by their lack of accountability in this matter. They allowed this host to manipulate the situation, lie, and essentially rob me, failing to protect their loyal users.

For all these reasons, I strongly advise everyone to avoid this platform unethically and unprofessionally. Unfortunately, Airbnb’s failure to address this situation only made it worse."

For ever a month I have been asking for more details about the hack as I want to better protect myself (I still don't know how this happened because no other account of mine or the other victim was hacked to my knowledge) and also tell the other victim what happened. But Airbnbs response makes everything more of a nightmare because they are just avoiding everything. I've had the account over a decade, and if this is how they're going to treat a long standing customer, I will never be using their platform again, and I will be sure to tell everyone this story when the companies name comes up"
2025-01-17,1,Airbnb provides zero help to its five star host,"On Airbnb, I offered my house up to people avoiding the fires in LA at a greatly discounted rate. I got a request from someone who said that she and her fiancé wanted to come visit her in-laws. Airbnb had a very discounted rate for their stay and said they were waiving their fees, but they did not explain why.  I thought Airbnb should give me a little bit more information about this situation, So I contacted Airbnb. I spoke to two people who were totally unable to help me. I was told that a third person was going to call me. They never called me. I’m thinking about switching to Vrbo because I think that Airbnb should be way more responsive to a five star host. From my perspective, Airbnb is a big liar. Be forewarned"
2025-01-17,4,Not so bad,"Not so bad, I was able to meet a lot of people thanks to AirBNB"
2025-01-17,1,Poor customer service,"There was a problem with the booking. The host said we were booked for two nights, but Airbnb noted that I wasn't booked and needed to book at least three. Customer Support wanted me to get ahold of the host through Airbnb and tell them to call them so they could help her fix things. Why would that be my responsibility? Airbnb should take care of the problem, not the customer!"
2025-01-16,1,AIRBNB is not supporting hosts,"AIRBNB is not supporting hosts. A host can have hundreds of five stars reviews, but when someone decide to give the same host a bad review, AIRBNB leave the review on the portal, and is not publishing the host answer. 

AIRBNB IS A BAD PARASITE 🦠 "
2025-01-15,1,Be careful when planning a trip to the…,"Be careful when planning a trip to the other side of the world using airbnb.

1. You can be left without accommodation, your account can be blocked without explanation, and you can get your money back only after some time, what to do if you spent most of your money on booking accommodation for a month and now you can’t pay for another one?
2. Your travel budget can change after being blocked for no reason. If you booked many apartments in advance at low season prices, and arrived in high season, then if your account is blocked, you can face many times higher prices, and even end up on the street because of this or seriously ruin your trip.

3. Do not expect a quick and fair solution to this issue. I did not violate any rules of the platform, used only personal bank cards, had respectful correspondence with everyone, not violating the rules. But my account was still blocked, without the possibility of recovery. Keep in mind."
2025-01-15,1,Airbnb is going DOWN,"As for the accommodations, it's always been a hit and miss, but what shocked me this time around was their customer service! One person promised a 10 USD discount for the host having cancelled, another one said it had been paid out, third said that I was never supposed to get it because of some credit (that the first person said was cancelled) and the fourth patronized me like a baby - well, you've been nice, so we'll extend your credit. WTF?
AirBNB must be going down if refunding a 10 USD that they PROMISED is not available to them...

We sent evidence of bed bugs and bites to AirBNB and they refused to help, and denied pictures as evidence, even though the host acknowledged.

Hi Diana, Thank you for your prompt reply, I don't know what's happened here but Air BnB have not added the cleaning fee, so unfortunately I am going to have to decline the booking, as I would only receive £217 from this booking and my changeover costs are £150 so it would make it impossible financially
I will have to take this up with Air BnB
I'm absolutely gutted and gutted for you as well but it's just not financially viable Wendy

2025-01-12,1,"It started off good, but then...","My family and I have traveled a lot together, and for a good while, Airbnb was our go-to resource for short-term rentals. We were considerate guests and always received good reviews from our hosts after each stay. Unfortunately, we had to learn the hard way how poorly Airbnb treats their customers in the event of a negative experience with an unscrupulous host. The rental in question had numerous issues with cleanliness, humidity, and the functionality of resources like water heating. Mildew was growing on the walls of one of the bedrooms. We didn't make any unreasonable demands of the host - we simply requested that he fix all that was supposed to have been functioning normally, given what was promised in the listing. At first he cooperated, albeit with a begrudging and arrogant tone, but he soon escalated his rudeness and in so many words informed us that we were complaining too much and would no longer receive any help from him. 

We were set to stay an additional month, but given the wide variety of issues that remained unresolved and the host's refusal to assist, we wanted to see if we could cancel without being charged. I contacted Airbnb support and their representative assured me that we would not face any penalties for a cancelation, nor would we be charged for the upcoming month. The representative was very clear on this point and the conversation was all in writing, so I felt confident enough to go forward with the cancelation. With assurances as clear and straightforward as this one, you can imagine my surprise when I saw a pending charge for the upcoming month. Once again, I contacted Airbnb, and I was informed by a different representative that they were going to charge me in full for the upcoming month in spite of what the previous representative had said. I showed them the records of the conversation, informed them that I would not have canceled unless I had received the go-ahead from the previous representative, but none of that was able to sway them in their determination to side with this ridiculous host and rip us off, even despite our spotless record of reviews and the fact that they knew they would be losing us as customers. 

In the time since that experience, I've done more research into similar debacles people have faced with greedy Airbnb hosts and the so-called support service that provides protection for their unethical behavior. It seems that the primary focus of this short-term rental monopoly is the quick cash grab and the maintenance of their stranglehold on the market. Privacy, honoring promises made by representatives, and overall customer welfare scarcely even make their list of priorities. We vowed to never again use their services after the highway robbery we experienced at their hands, and given all the scandalous news stories that have come out since then, it seems we might have been lucky to have gotten out when we did."
2025-01-12,1,Expensive booking and cleaning fees,"I cant believe how much extra airbnb charge on top of the price per night that is advertised. It is very deceptive. Once you press 'book "" a cleaning charge is added and an airbnbs fee. In this instance £70 for cleaning and £100 airbnb fees for 4 nights. I don't know why the cleaning fee isn't included in the daily price. 
Airbnb need to be more transparent with the prices. If they continue to charge such a high percentage of the price and dont put the total price on the property advertising page, then I won't be using them anymore."
2025-01-12,1,Kafka-esque,"This is a review of the customer service to property managers rather than the app. 

They announced they were going to remove my advert with a 4.5 rating because of unspecified issues which may have been related to a customer complaint. They then say I can appeal if I can give evidence related to the removal. Since they haven't said why the advert is being removed it is difficult to prove why it is wrong. The have offered me the opportunity to correct whatever gave offense, but they refuse to tell me what it is, if anything, that caused offense, implying that as the homeowner, I should know. 

This approach is of course the same as the witch-burning trials of the 17th Century, where only by admitting guilt to an unknown accusation can you even begin to show contrition. It is also the plot of Kafka's ""The Trial"" about Stalin's system of justice."
2025-01-12,1,Extremely Disappointing Customer Service and Misrepresentation,"I have been a long-time Airbnb user, and until recently, my experiences were generally positive. However, my latest booking has completely changed my perception of the platform.

I booked a long-term stay at a property in Spain, expecting the listing to match the description. Unfortunately, this was far from the case. The property was grossly misrepresented in the following ways:

Location Misrepresentation: The listing claimed the property was 15 km from Seville, but it is at least 18 km. This added significant travel time, doubling the public transport duration to over an hour and ten minutes.

False Features: There was no terrace or courtyard view as described—just a small balcony overlooking a white wall. The kitchen was described as ""fully equipped,"" but the cookware was damaged, crockery was chipped, and the kitchen walls had visible damp with water dripping down.

Health Hazards: Damp and mold were present from day one, causing sinus infections and allergies. The bathroom ceiling was also peeling.

Unsafe and Noisy Area: Contrary to the description of a quiet and safe neighborhood, the area was noisy with hourly church bells and felt unsafe due to poorly lit streets and garbage.


When I reported these issues to the host, they were dismissive and unhelpful. I then contacted Airbnb Support, expecting resolution. However, I discovered that Airbnb has no formal complaint process. Refunds are entirely dependent on the host's discretion, even when there is clear evidence of misrepresentation.

This experience has been incredibly frustrating. Airbnb’s customer service is slow and ineffective, leaving guests like me to deal with uncooperative hosts and unsuitable properties. I feel Airbnb prioritizes its hosts over the well-being of its guests, which undermines trust in the platform.

I hope Airbnb takes this feedback seriously and implements a clear, impartial resolution process for guests. As of now, I would not recommend Airbnb to others, particularly for long-term stays, given their lack of accountability and consumer protection."

2025-01-12,1,"I am a resort owner, other people selling my property without my permission ","I am a resort owner, and  my resort was used by a stranger who was selling stays at my resort without my permission,  it was very difficult to find the way to communicate with airbnb team, when I eventually reached I wasn't taken very seriously and it sounded complicated even to carry on dealing with them.  I see that lady has over 1000 property on her account,  so basically what she does, she advertising properties at higher price then booking. com and then when guest books with her she makes booking on her name through booking. com or agoda, for me ots a scam as people overpaying and I am as resort owner have problems with reviews because if I am 3* and cheap my price is for the value I provide, but if people pay a lot and expect a lot that's a disappointment.  Also this lady Patinee left lowest reviews on my place when she never stayed at my place and the couple who stayed where very happy but review from their stay left not them but the lady who booked for them. And I am sure it's because I found that fraud and told her why you using my property to make money? She took off her account my property obviously now, but what is my point, there's probably a lot of people like her who duplicate advertisements with higher price and scamming people,  they don't have any taxes to pay, or wages...or cover the cost of maintenance the property  like property owners,  it's not good to make money this way. AIRBNB should take care more seriously on advertising , you should ask every property owner to provide documents and proof that you are the owner straight from beginning advertising on airbnb.  And in general to respect more property owners because we are opening our doors to strangers, letting them into our property, we trusting and we should get good income but not the middle person who gets very easy money not owning a single property.  Can you please check always the host, how many properties they have and it will be clear who scamer as when it has over a 1000 properties its obviously something not right. I am happy to share host pics but not sure how. The name is Patinee,  please avoid her!!!! "

2025-01-11,1,Stop using AIRBNB now for your safety ,"Airbnb was a good company before but now but now Airbnb has not only started hacking and stealing your data but its a complete bully. 

Due to privacy and security concern both host and guests are at risk.

Service is very bad as most hosts are fake or property pictures are fake. 

We lose £700 due to fake advertises in more then 3 countries. 

Airbnb is only about their high fees. They dont care about guest. For hosts they have special services. They have too much chinese host having scam on platform. 

Mostly if you book properties and the day you checkin you get message its cancelled and you are on road nowhere.

2ndly when you come to checkin the host will give you very bad condition dirty property which was not you booked. Most pictures are completely fake. Most properties are fake.

There are no rules. If you complain they will block you on their airbnb platform. They will accuse you for anything and deny giving you any evidence. 

They are complete bully to people. 

Please stop using airbnb immediately for your safety.

If you have problem they respond even after days. 

We have full evidence whoever need we will send online. 

This company needs to be closed shut down.

2025-01-11,1,I wanted to give AirBNB zero,"I wanted to give AirBNB zero, but the option was not available. First beware of fraud. Somehow, AirBnB billed me for a booking by some unknown third party for a £700.00 holiday in Indonesia, where I have never been or planned to go. The cash was deducted without my knowledge or consent from my bank account.  While challenging this over a period of six weeks,  my actual booking in Sydney NSW was cancelled without my knowledge, leaving me to scramble for an alternative at the last moment. It has taken me from December 3 2024 until January 10, 2025 to have the cash restored. In the meantime, my Airbnb password has been declined and I now cannot access my current booking. It is impossible to speak to anyone in authority. Any letters from senior figures are signed by first name only and are unresponsive to further communication. I will report back on the quality of the accommodation (if I ever get to use it). In a word: BEWARE."

Airb&b with its host are attempting to racketeer. All nice and creepy on booking and sharks 🦈 upon leaving. Hold your ground and give them two fingers is my advise or just don’t risk it. I won’t be booking via them again. Be warned!!
2025-01-10,1,Unacceptable advertising ,"I had a stay of 10 days through Christmas until December 29. The property listed #99 Vegas Pool and Spa. Although listed at a higher end price over $1,000 a night, and amenities and pictures for our needs during this holiday period, I booked it. Upon booking I asked for a courtesy walk through to insure price matched advertisement. I was denied! Upon check in, the house had a security issue. I don’t go into all the minute details but the house was accessible from single car garage. House was not cleaned in many areas. Again I won’t go into details because of numerous items. Notified host as well as Airbnb support. I was never contacted by host. Airbnb said someone would check it out. No one came. Second day we had a water leak from upped floor bathroom, coming through floor to laundry room. Contacted host and Airbnb. No response from host. Airbnb said someone would come. 3rd day someone came and said toilet was leaking. He would return yo fix. Later that day another water leak from shower. Contacted Airbnb and host. Nothing from host. Airbnb sent plumber. He said he could only make temporary repairs. Left and didn’t see anyone else return. Water is now leaking in laundry room and living room. I started a further inspection of property and found several listed amenities were not available or not working. Contacted host and Airbnb. No host response. A this point I started documenting everything I could find that was in disrepair and forwarded a detail list to host and Airbnb. Now 6 days into stay and Airbnb said they couldn’t refund but might try to find something else to move to. I have 16 people in my party with children celebrating Christmas. Where am supposed to go now??? I asked just as well as Airbnb for a five night refund for inconvenience, false advertisement and repairs that caused me to wait and readjust my activities with my family. Long story short, host was not communicating, Airbnb felt they couldn’t make any major decisions about refunding me. I contacted the BBB as well as the code enforcement office for the city of the listed property. Airbnb has been uncooperative in and host never made contact with me. I was offered a trivial amount of restitution but nothing acceptable for all the issues encountered. Very disappointing in this property and Airbnb."
2025-01-10,1,Will not book with Airbnb again.,"Will not book with Airbnb again.

Booked a property in France that once we arrived and reviewed was clearly a fraudulent listing as the photos on the listing certainly did not match the standard of the apartment. The apartment was awful. There were also photos used that were not even of the apartment. 

Raised a complaint that was dealt with dreadfully. Being in the UK everything was being returned when I was asleep. Asked for a manager to call me during acceptable UK hours and was ignored. I asked again to speak to a manager and eventually spoke with someone that kept banging on about policy and how the most refund I could be given was 30% which was completely unacceptable given the atrocious condition of the apartment in which we stayed. Had to fight to get 50% and was made to feel like they were doing me a favour. Accepted this as did not have the energy to keep being ignored, to not be taken seriously and to keep fighting. 

Watch out - there are obviously some very very good and honest hosts but there are some who just want to make money out of their properties but are not prepared to spend money on the upkeep or repairs needed to keep standards for guests high. And it looks like Airbnb don’t really want to do anything after the event, as first time bookers we didn’t know we should have raised these issues at the time to be moved somewhere else. I was concerned for the repercussions of issues during our visit if I had raised the issues at the time due to the host being very unhelpful."
2025-01-09,1,Misleading prices & advertising.,"I have spent the last few weeks trying to book a family break for Xmas 2025.  Lots of availability which was encouraging however my joy ended there.  For some reason there seems to be no guidelines from Airbnb to prevent hosts from massively increasing their advertised prices.  I have tried to book around a dozen properties and every single one has come back and more than doubled the advertised price and most have also said they want a minimum 7 night stay.  If the website quotes a price and you hit ""book"" then that price should be locked in and honoured.  This is seriously fraudulent, misleading and completely false advertising."
2025-01-09,1,Worst travel nightmare! ,"I am having the worst travel nightmare ever thanks to Airbnb!

I applied for a refund to a reservation which was 100% refundable, with even a courteous suggestion from the host themselves due to some construction happening next door, the “refund approval” was not the problem, but actually getting the as the bank account I had paid with was closed and hence the bank said they can no longer accept payment to a closed account nor route it as it is illegal to do that in the US with a closed account, but no matter how much I explain that (over a 100 times literally) they're refusing to help find other ways to pay me back (even though there are others who’ve reported a resolution) and the supervisors literally said ""no one in Airbnb can help with that"" which basically means I would lose a huge sum of money! They keep ""escalating"" and keep sending it to the same closed account and keep going in the same loop almost every day for the past 3 weeks (still going). I'm out traveling in a different time zone and stayed up all night without food or sleep to get it resolved and in the process got very sick I also found out that some have actually been able to get refunded other ways due to some privilege or connections (I don't know how /where they got help) but I keep getting harassed by hearing the same over and over, that they can't send payment any other way, I even shared that thread and they're still refusing to help (especially the supervisors whose power only allows them to say and do whatever they please). I can’t contact anyone in the USA who might be actually be aware of US laws and policies of bank. They keep copy pasting the same canned message and also repeat over phone! I was also told if someone says they can help that's a lie (so basically they’re saying their own employees have lied) and they keep closing all threads where there's some crucial information and there's no way to contact anyone except to hear the same thing OVER AND OVER again and get into the same loop!

This has caused me a nightmare and have gotten terribly sick in my travel due to this. I can't even get in touch with their legal team! Due to time difference I can't even contact legal help without going through more sleepless nights and getting sicker!

Many have mentioned same issues but only one or done (who seems with some connections) seems to have gotten it magically resolved. This is not even the first time I've had issues but definitely the worst (or the worst is yet to come as I am getting very sick in the process!)

I hope more guests avoid Airbnb to give a chance to other platforms so this nightmare ends! 

This wasn’t one day issue (about 3 weeks and still going) but I had to enter a date! I hope someone here can help with filing a complaint regarding this to the lawmakers! "

This discourages renters from leaving true reviews which skews everything on Airbnb.  Don't be fooled this has turned into something that works well for the hosts, but gives renters a lot worse properties than they think they are going to get, and basically keeps renters from getting properties if they leave honest reviews that are negative.  We are currently at an airbnb property now where there are several negatives that would have kept us from renting, but now I am afraid of documenting these in my review due to not being able to have hosts approve me for future visits.  I am going to use VRBO more in the future or booking.com, because airbnb is poorly run and thrives on doing things like this that shaft the renter.
I believe there are hosts that do not even own properties now on airbnb and are trying to broker units that are timeshares that are vacant, so they tell you they have a unit with a range of dates, when they really only have a few weeks available for the whole range, so they are constantly rejecting my requests for the week we needed for vacation, which creates a huge hassle for renters, who are waiting for approvals in good faith and waste time getting rejected over and over again, because the host is selfishly trying to fill one or two weeks for a vacation property they do not even own.

For example we booked an apartment with WiFi and a TV as we are traveling with a 3yr old and needed something for entertainment for him in the evening. When we called Airbnb about it they said they would contact the owners and email us their response. We waited all day with no response so we called Airbnb again only to be told that there was no record of our 1st call or complaints and to go back and take pictures of everything and upload it to the app and await a response. This simply isn't good enough. I will never use Airbnb again and will advise anyone else against it. Stick with legit booking providers like booking.com. "
2025-01-06,1,Unreliable anymore...,"

Here’s a draft for your negative review:  

---

I’ve had a disappointing experience with Airbnb and would not recommend it to renters. The platform clearly favors property owners over renters, making it difficult to resolve issues fairly. Hidden fees are everywhere, and by the time you check out, the total cost is often much higher than advertised. Nowadays many of the owners add a high cleaning fee on top of the rent, but still require renters should keep the house clean, ridiculously! 

Even worse, Airbnb doesn't seem to take complaints seriously. I had an issue with a property that was falsely advertised, but despite my detailed evidence, Airbnb refused to investigate or take meaningful action. It’s clear they prioritize keeping hosts happy over protecting renters from fraud or poor experiences.  

Overall, Airbnb is unreliable and feels like a gamble every time. Save yourself the stress and look for alternatives where your concerns will actually be heard and addressed.  "

2025-01-06,1,Airbnb is a joke. They use AI instead of real people to help you out.,"I was trying to book a staycation for my friends, just for a night, but Airbnb wouldn’t let me because it doesn’t allow one night stays anymore in an apartment. It believes I’m throwing an ‘unauthorised party’. I tried to appeal this and called customer service, but they said that it was out of their hands and it was up to a specialised team to work it out. later get an email that they’ve denied my appeal. I call them again appeal again and they denied it again.They said I can only book private rooms and hotels.What’s the point of Airbnb then? If I wanted to book a hotel… I would go to a hotel website and book a hotel. I want a whole apartment to stay with my friends, so we can cook and spend time for the night. There is no one to actually prove my case to and the customer service team is not given the tools to help me out.

2025-01-05,1,Airbnb is crooked/ not on your side,"These people that run Airbnb are crooks. They do not care if you stay in a roach motel... if the experience was horrible with one of their properties,  they keep your money and tell you to go blow it out your ear. I will never rent another Airbnb   property again.  There is no recourse if you get stuck in a dirty, run down rental. Period. "
2025-01-05,1,AIRBNB MEMBERS NEED TO BE MORE RESPECTFUL,"I am a host in Bali and I cannot believe how rude and arrogant AIRBNB members are.

They are 100% the most stingy guests we have but expect a million dollar service but don't have the money to pay for it, so sad!

AIRBNB needs to start telling their members to show a bit of respect to host's.

It actually makes me feel sick and disgusted when I get a AIRBNB booking because I know the members are just low class people that think they are above all other human beings.

We won't use the platform anymore not because of the company but because of it's gross members."
2025-01-04,5,"‘ A Clean, Well Lighted Place.’ ","After four consecutive days of round the clock rain, my roof opened a crack and my  basement flooded. With the  weight of the downpour threatening to open the ceiling I decided to stay somewhere else while they were working to make the repairs. So I opened the  Airbnb app on my mobile device and braced myself for the high prices and low availability that New Years Eve usually causes.  I found a vacancy at the Carlisle apartments and requested reservation. Within three, maybe four minutes I received an answer from the Host, who identified herself as Leah. I couldn’t believe that it was open, nor could I believe the price. I thought there HAD to have been a 2 night minimum stay, but there wasn’t any. I confirmed and, once again Keah responded with the address, access code and, something that almost every front desk hotel agent forgets during checking; the WIFI credentials. 
The apartment was immaculately cleaned and meticulously appointed. We settled in and had a wonderful evening. I even cooked dinner. The night seemed to vanish and at nine the next morning I received a call from the roofing contractor informing me that the work would be finished at 11;00 AM. We hurriedly dressed, washed dishes and left. I found out later that we left in such a hurry that I forgot to leave Leah a note that I had used all of the dish detergent for evening and morning meals. She was most gracious and kind. During my matriculation to Dayton I stayed at 5-6 Airbnb properties and interacted with the respective hosts, each being a consummate professional. Yet, Leah stands head and shoulders above them all. I can even expand on that assessment. I’m a retired Certified Hospitality Sales Executive with 36 years of experience throughout the country. I’ve worked in Atlanta ,San Jose , San Francisco and in the RDU areas. I’ve trained several new sales managers and mentored many with experience. Leah’s customer centrism eclipses many of them. She makes it EASY to do business with her brand. Even when faux pas’ like the fish soap and the pot holder, my friend accidentally burned. Leah was a sincere pro! The AIRBNB organization brand is so fortunate to have an individual like Leah. Going forward, I’ll be recommending AIRBNB to my clients, visiting family members and others who are coming to Dayton on business strictly using Leah’s example as the benchmark for their expectations. I’m convince that if AIRBNB had the foresight to choose Leah, there must be other Hosts here that mirror her skill set and display, as she did, that know exactly what  the word !HOSPITALITY’ means:  A love for strangers’.

Good luck trying to speak to a manager, the customer services will fight tooth and nail to stop you proceeding with a complaint.

With regards to a complaint, this company has NO complaints procedure. If you disagree with them, they simply tell its tough luck.

Oh and isint it telling how many bad reviews are on here and yet the company cant be arsed to address the reviews. I think it speaks volumes when a company like AIRBNB or BOOKING.COM dont respond to these comments left by their customers, feels like they're happy to take our money and take us for granted."

We had a completely different unauthorized person from the person who booked it turn up and enter our family home. They then tried to extort us threatening legal action if we didn’t transfer them personally a full refund personally (rather than use the platform as required) due to one second living area were not having curtains (which was clear in the photos and normal for the area) we then asked them to leave when we realized it was an imposter/fraud/extortion/scam and they refused demanding money. We had to call the London police. Airbnb were no help whatsoever and have simply refused to forward us the booking money leaving us hugely distressed while on our own family holiday and a significant financial loss and lost opportunity. The booking was non refundable and the property was as described and photos as per the condition. We had no complaints from prior guests. Despite this and the main fact they allowed a non vetted and unauthorized person enter our family home and threaten us then denied us our legal entitled booking fee is appalling. This scammer then left our home unlocked and in a mess and has potentially stolen items we need to audit when we arrive back from our holiday. We are now having to launch legal proceedings via the FCA and our lawyers along with the police. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE AIRBNB TO LIST YOUR PRECIOUS HOME AND PLEASE USE AN ALTERNATIVE PLATFORM OR PROFESSIONAL AGENCY AIRBNB IS SIMPLY A SCAM AND SHOULD BE SHUTDOWN BY AUTHORITIES. "
2025-01-03,1,Threats by racist host,"The customer support is a real joke. I was threatened by a host with numerous messages, including racist ones. I wait almost 4 days until an Aibnb employee calls me at 1am and then closes the case 4 hours later at 5am (while I'm sleeping) because I didn't reply.

The staff on the normal hotline are absolutely useless and can't help you at all."
2025-01-03,1,Do not use AIRBNB!!,"Do not use AIRBNB!!! Nor for bookings or as a host. Their only objective is to get money out of you and anything in between does not matter to them.

I had a condo booked for 8 nights.
In the middle of the stay, the guest wants to cancel. I tell them it's not possible due to my cancellation policy and then they contacted AirBNB who then just cancelled their booking without my consent. I was completely confused and tried to contact AirBNB to figure out what is happening. The guest then stays longer in the condo than the check-out date of the cancellation, telling me it's in accordance with the agreement they made with AirBNB. Again, i'm confused and try to contact AirBNB, but they are not reachable and do not answer my support messages.

While they cancelled the booking, they removed the booking entirely from my booking calendar, so i started getting bookings while having guests in the room.

I had to reject these and ask them to book again later. Luckily they were okay with that, but then AirBNB added the booking back into my calendar, so someone obviously was reading my messages but just didn't want to reply me. The result being that they were not able to book, because now the calendar was blocked until the end of the original stay.

For me, i had guests living for free in my condo because of AirBNB support making that agreement with them without my consent and i lost a booking.

The support is completely neglecting their responsibility and just gives me automated responses and telling me that i can just ask the guest for money myself.

But the guest is long gone and will not pay me anything.

AirBNB was the broker on this deal and took it upon themselfe to give out my condo for free and make sure i lost other bookings in high season here.

I lost more than 600 USD in rental income because of this and no matter how i look at it, i can only see AirBNB being responsible.

Yet, when i contact them, explain my case, they will ignore it all and just give me some automated responses.

I can not stress this enough.
DO NOT USE AIRBNB as a host, they have no interest in you and in case of mistakes, they will not be taking any responsibility.

We are moving out of Airbnb to other booking platforms from January and i urge other hosts to do the same."

2025-01-02,1,Property in bad area,"The property I went to was in an area with actual gang activity right up the street in Washington DC. I had concerns about the property as soon as I pulled on the street. Once I parked I saw all the trash on the ground, beer cans, red cups and other litter in the area. The property I stayed is a renovated unit surrounded by run down conditions. There is no way Airbnb did any verification of how safe the location is or verified any of the reviews of people that say they rented the property previously. I relied on the reviews when making my decision to reserve that property and feel that Airbnb was not concerned about my safety and the safety of my family. I was only at the property long enough to recognize that I would be safe staying at that location. Airbnb informed me that the host is making the decision to stand on the refund policy in the agreement but that policy didn't include any consideration for situations where safety is a concern. I was only given 268.00 of the 1270.00 that I paid for the reservation. Be careful, Airbnb doesn't care about your safety."

Not even glass for the wine, no bottle of water or even carafe to store some. The only thing that Airbnb replied about their obligations: 
""I wanted to clarify the host’s responsibilities regarding amenities during your stay. While we understand that you expect certain amenities to be provided, it's important to note that hosts are only obligated to provide some basic essentials.

As per Airbnb’s policies, the host is required to provide the following:

Toilet paper
Soap (for hands and body)
One towel per guest
One pillow per guest
Linens for each guest bed
Other items that you may be expecting may not fall under the host’s obligations.

For a detailed overview of the host’s responsibilities regarding amenities, we recommend reviewing the following Help Center article: airbnb/help/article/2343."""
2024-12-31,2,We met a hostess on air bnb…,"We met a hostess on air bnb and we did a long term stay. After some time of me staying, I asked if I could stay longer. She said yes and required money to be paid directly and not via ABNB. I have never done this before and she seemed nice. Calling me “like her daughter and my son like a grandson” , 8 months later, and after everything was good, we got approved for an apartment. Bc we had gotten close, I asked for her blessing for this new transition. This is where things took an evil turn. She said bc I didn’t give her three weeks notice, I need to be out in 24 hours. I told her I don’t have keys yet to my place until 1-3-25. She didn’t care about that. She also didn’t care that I paid for full month for $850. She then threatened me and stated to pay her $30 a day until I leave and “succumb”. Idk what tf she meant by “succumb” but I’m packing TODAY and leaving with my son. For your safety, DO NOT do a long term stay with Gloria Ubong Okulaja in Richmond Texas. She won’t show her face on ABNB but uses cartoons in place of a photo. Keep your money and book elsewhere. "
2024-12-31,1,Flat infested with cockroaches ,I stayed in a flat infested by cockroaches. The WiFi wasn't working. There was a hole in the door. The pot plant leaked brown liquid all over the floor. I reported all the issues to Airbnb support which is really terrible. They provided no help at all. They asked for video evidence which I sent of everything. And then they said it was insufficient. Clearly Airbnb doesn't care about their customers and are just here to cover for their hosts. 
2024-12-31,1,Avoid!!!,Avoid! Booked 2 bookings and both of them afterwards said oh sorry btw we are out of rooms. And no further communication. How do I report scam listings? How do I repport a host? How do I contact airbnb and get my money back without having to call some uk number from Asia....horrible. I will never use airbnb again !
2024-12-31,1,"Do not, under any circumstances, become an Airbnb host!","I have been a host for Airbnb for about a year, very irregularly. As I live in another town, I have to travel a long way to set up my accommodation. Therefore, I do not accept last minute cancellations. Now, a sweaty bicycle traveler with probably ten different types of small plastic bags on her bike turned up in my flat. After a day of staying there (and apparently having done her laundry), this person wanted to cancel the rest of her reservation. She wrote: ""My friend is sick! I must help her..."" ( What a lousy lie). I received a question through the Airbnb system asking if I accept the cancellation. I clicked on ""decline"", but nevertheless I soon got a message that the booking was cancelled. When I protested to Airbnb, they told me the host had ""moderated"" my rule (???!?!!). 
In one day the person had managed to thoroughly mess up my apartment, left uneaten food in the fridge and washed probably ten loads of laundry (I judged by how much detergent had been used). Yet the person still managed to berate the standard of my apartment as a reprisal for not letting her cancel. The review no longer mentioned the ""sick friend"", but said the standard of the apartment was so low (for a cycling, sweaty traveller!) that she had to cancel the booking. All the other guests had given the apartment the highest possible score (5). Now, months later, Airbnb is still charging me more than 80 euros for this cancellation, which caused me so much headache. How many days have I spent on this matter and now this! That I am being made to pay (presumably the cyclist who cancelled the accommodation will also have to pay his share to Airbnb). And this is only one trouble with Airbnb I have had. They are so many, that I decided I will no longer continue hosting with Airbnb, as none of the rules I have created apply and everything is really complicated, vague and nothing can be trusted. I had also made a rule that I only wanted to accommodate people who had stayed there before (with reviews), but suddenly I started getting bookings from first-timers. Of course, Airbnb wants to get as much money as possible from both hosts and guests and they are constantly going to the limit of where the rights of the consumer are when the system is really unclear. I will boycott Airbnb for the rest of my life, and I certainly do not recommend booking or hosting to anyone. Now I see from these Trustpilot comments that there are already a lot of us. To summarize, do not, under any circumstances, become an Airbnb host! "
2024-12-31,1,No humans work for Airbnb ,"I booked two nights at a resort through AirBnb.  Confirmed by the host apparently as I have the email to say they have approved the stay.

This was for 30th and 31st December, New Years Eve.  I turn up after biking most the day from north of Pai to near Chiang Mai and knock on the hosts door.  A gentleman appears and asks if I have a booking.  I show the email and he tells me they have nothing to do with Airbnb for years and no way of connecting with them to disconnect from their bookings system.  

So no way of the host cancelling my stay so I can get refunded and help from Airbnb for what to do next.  

I couldn't get hold of anyone from Airbnb, still now, 2 days since the failed check in!  Their call center options don't work and their messages go unread, unreplied and then close due to inactivity!! 

I've got everything documented to show how many support tickets I've got open and closed.  Recorded their call centres not making the call, not even allowing to retry the number!

I was left to find another place but on 30th December, everywhere had hiked prices x5 so had to get a flight to Bangkok where I found the same issue with prices.  

Totally shafted by Airbnb 

Is it literally just one or two people who work for Airbnb?  Overpaid CEOs probably."
2024-12-31,1,Worse on earth,"Worse customer service on earth. Spent 40 minutes and got no where. Cant reach anyone that understands the issue. Wouldn't let my wife and I make changes to account unless we were together which wasn't possible. They posted my properties with out our consent and no one will help us. They promised to send us a letter saying that there system posted our properties in error with out are permission then didnt do it. We are getting fined by the Honolulu City & County because they posted our old listings with out our permission and all we asked is if they could please send us a letter confirming this so we could defend our position. After hours on the phone and multiple promises, we still dont have the letter saying they made the error. They are leaving us out to the wolves. Airbnb should be honorable and just send us the letter so the government doesnt fine us for there mistake. Terrible loyalty to us after giving them business for over 10 years. Dont work with them, support other companies that rent houses."
2024-12-31,1,USE EXTREME CAUTION!!!!," I am writing to share an extremely distressing experience with Airbnb's booking system. I am currently in Atlanta to be near my fiancé, who is in critical condition at Piedmont Hospital with a traumatic brain injury following a severe car accident. After purchasing a $500 Airbnb gift card from Walmart to secure accommodation near the hospital for myself, my son, and my sister, I encountered significant issues. 

Upon attempting to book a property, Airbnb's AI system incorrectly flagged my reservation, citing concerns about ""unauthorized parties"" and potential vandalism. These accusations are completely unfounded - I am a 55-year-old individual trying to stay close to my critically ill fiancé. When I attempted to book a different property, I received the same automated rejection. 

Airbnb then informed me that this decision could not be overturned and suggested I book a hotel or private room instead. This defeats the purpose of purchasing an Airbnb gift card, which I specifically bought to secure appropriate accommodation for my family during this medical crisis. 

My attempts to resolve this issue have been met with promises of return calls that never materialize. I now have $500 trapped in an Airbnb account that I cannot use, and more importantly, no suitable place to stay while supporting my fiancé during this critical time. This system failure has created unnecessary stress during an already challenging personal crisis. 

I request immediate attention to this matter and a full refund of my gift card balance. Airbnb's automated systems should not prevent legitimate guests from securing necessary accommodation, I'm especially in emergency situations like mine."
2024-12-30,1,Appalling,"Appalling. Booked a five day Christmas break and dinner at a local hotel. I didn’t even unpack, it was a damp, cramped dump. Turned straight back out the door. Four and a half hour drive home. No Christmas dinner. Promised a partial refund. After several phone calls I gave up. Call centre in India and no hope of any service. Lost almost £600. "
2024-12-30,1,Ripped off. They've stolen my money.,"Opened an AirBnB account to book a one night stay. Paid partially with a £50 gift card. It then transpired that you need valid ID, which I don't have. 
I don't drive, I no longer travel abroad, and my expired passport won't do. They do not tell you that you need valid ID until after you have booked and paid. 

I've cancelled the booking, and apologised to the host. AirBnB have refunded both the gift card and the cash for the booking, but they have credited the gift card to my AirBnB account which, of course, is useless because I can never book anything because I don't have ID. So this feels like theft because I'm down £50 and they're in the money. This was a Christmas gift, which is now in their bank account.

I was on the phone to their customer service, who suggested I renew my passport and then try to book something. They could have refunded me by issuing another gift card that we could use on my husband's account, but no.
It's also very difficult to contact Customer Services through their message system without anyone thinking you have an emergency situation and calling the emergency services. If you happen to be in the middle of an emergency, I seriously doubt you're going to toggle all the way to the AirBnB message tray, for them to take forever to respond, anyway.

*UPDATE*  Airbnb Customer Services have offered a solution to the problem. They have suggested that my husband open an account, verify his ID, and then buy another £50 gift card to credit to his account, so that we can then use that to make a booking. Basically, their solution is for us to give Airbnb more money. Genius. Why didn't I think of that?"
2024-12-30,1,AirBnB refuse booking and refuse to refund payment,"Booked accommodation with a gift card and cash, but unable to prove my id, expired passport and don't drive,  so according to airbnb I don't exist. Now airbnb  refuse to refund my money. "

2024-12-30,2,AirBnb Let Me Down,"I had been a die-hard Airbnb fan until my last experience. The host unfairly and untruely accused me of damaging a piece of furniture that wasn't even in the house! When I refused to pay her, she blasted me on a review. I reached out to Airbnb multiple times to get the review taken down because it was UNTRUE and bogus, but they will not remove it. The customer service rep I spoke to really didn't understand me at all. I feel really disappointed as they were my ""go to"" for finding great places to stay."
2024-12-30,1,* DO NOT BECOME A HOST THEY WILL STOP…,"* DO NOT BECOME A HOST THEY WILL STOP BOOKINGS JUST BECAUSE OF ONE BAD REVIEW. I HAVE LOST THOUSANDS BECAUSE OF ONE BAD REVIEWE, THEY ARE REMOVING MY LISTING. EVEN THOUGH EVERY OTHER REVIEW WAS FIVE STAR, I’VE TRIED TO SPEAK TO THEM BUT THEY WILL NOT LISTEN. PLEASE KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PLATFORM."
2024-12-30,3, Not Too Shabby for First-Timers…,"It was our one and only experience with AirBnb thus far from a few months ago, and while we’ve staved off of utilizing them for years - there really wasn’t much of a choice in one of our trips recently due to the secluded destination we were traveling to as well as the high season for fall foliage. Most hotels were booked to the max and we had extremely limited options and decided to chance it with one of the properties offered on AirBnB. What I thoroughly enjoyed as a tough customer was the reviews provided per property in order to make a sound decision. Sure, I’m not going to take each and every review into consideration if they come off as unreasonable and/or silly but plenty of times low ratings are there for a reason, and especially when folks spend their hard-earned cash to have a good vacation and precious time with their loved ones. After much poring of reviews and accumulated time reviewing various properties, we finally settled on one and luckily it did not disappoint! The property was even better in person and the housecleaning was immaculate. We had no need for further assistance until after the trip, but other than that - for the two nights we’ve spent, we’ve had no complaints. We did leave a camping blanket behind by accident when we left the property and after much back and forth with the owner, we’ve soon realized it was a hassle to even get it shipped. We won’t rule out AirBnb in the future since we are dealing with individual folks but all in all, we can only rate it as neutral for the time being since it was our first experience. We’re not planning on making it into a habit because plenty of mishaps can go awry with vacation rentals like these and who has the time for that? Based on the endless reviews all across the Internet of negative experiences with AirBnb, we are still wary with choosing them whenever we travel. We have and always will stick with mainly hotels as our first option. "
2024-12-30,1,"I have two young children, am about to run out of heating oil and airbnb won't pay me. ","I have spent the last 48 hours on the phone with countless Airbnb support team members. I  have been a host for four years and have ""Super Host"" status. 
I am paid exactly 24 hours after a guest checks into my home.  Except I was supposed to be paid two days ago and I have not been paid. 
As I mentioned, I have been on the phone trying to get help and get paid literally non stop for two days.  I have two small children, I will run out of heating oil tomorrow, I live in the North East with frigid temperatures and I have 3 dollars in my bank account. To say I need and was counting on this Airbnb payment is an understatement.  
Nothing has been resolved. The issue has been passed from person to person.  Escalated to their Senior Case Managers, to Supervisors and nothing.  No resolution.  They say the money has been sent and they ""don't know why it hasn't been received"" by me.  They are now suggesting I contact my bank which I can't do until tomorrow as today is Sunday and I will more than likely run out of heat tonight. 
The last text I received from them was from a support member saying they will check in on my case ""from time to time"" to see if it's been resolved.  It couldn't be more clear that it's of no importance to the company that there are actual people that are Airbnb ""hosts"" 

I could not feel more defeated by this company and treated like a number.  They have essentially said it is my problem to figure out. It's just outrageous how little they care about the people that are actually driving their business and making them successful. "
2024-12-30,1,Airbnb Assistance Prioritizes Hosts Over Guests,"I am deeply disappointed with Airbnb’s assistance, which seems heavily biased toward host protection. Despite clear faults by the host—forcing us to switch apartments mid-stay and allowing cleaning staff to access our apartment without notice or authorization—Airbnb deemed me ineligible for a refund. Their lack of support was shocking, and my holiday was ruined. This experience has severely diminished my trust in the platform."

2024-12-30,2,"AirBnB is good, bad and ugly","AirBnB has good, bad and ugly. The question you have to ask yourself is, do you feel lucky punk?

The good is that I've had a majority of positive experiences with AirBnB over many years. I've stayed in interesting places, met interesting hosts and had authentic experiences I would not have had staying at a Marriott or Hilton. 

The bad is, those experiences have been degrading over time, getting worse and worse. Getting more vanilla, less interesting, less authentic and more expensive.

The ugly is that some of the worst experiences I've had were on AirBnB. I can't trust an AirBnB reservation exists. I've had auto-confirmations for AirBnB listings that were abandoned so when the day came to check-in, I was left with no place to stay in a foreign country and AirBnB support was useless. 

So ask yourself, do you feel lucky punk?"

2024-12-28,1,Probably our last use of AirBnB,"We had rather an unsatisfactory visit to Kereru Cottage in Little River, Christchurch, NZ. Unsatisfactory because the photographs were well out of date and the place was not clean. We had to undertake cleaning of floors and worktops and repair curtain rails upon arrival. Bins both inside and outside of the property had not been emptied and the recycling was overflowing. We tried to address the matter with AirBnB but have been totally ignored by them. We can only assume that the Reviews either side of our visit are fake and of course, negative reviews such as ours are not published. I would go as far as to suggest that AirBnB’s management of situations such as ours is bordering on being illegal due to misrepresentation and subsequent inaction.

I opened a case, spent time on the phone.  They responded by message saying the were right we were wrong and closed the case - no discussion.
I re opened the case, went through the whole rigmarole again and then when I didn’t answer a message within in a few hours they closed the case again. Again I tried, we reverted  to phone calls, again if you weren’t available they closed the case.    I asked to communicate by email or message.  Email was not available, messaging was but again the phone kept ringing  when I wasn’t available.  I rang back a number of times but again I had to wait for them to call me back, no managers were ever available when I called back.
Finally the issue went further up the chain, but again I had to go through it all again and we were back to messaging.  They are looking into it but I’ve given up now.   For the amount of money that is in dispute it simply isn’t worth what feels like script reading and harassment.  They closed one of the cases I opened ( same issue ) on Christmas Day as I didn’t respond.   It’s like the system is set up to grind you down until you give up the dispute."
2024-12-28,1,One star is even too much . ,"One star is even too much. I won't even touch on all the issues with Air bnb customer service and website where a few people were really good but most , including the host , were problematic.  i will only elaborate here on  one issue ,  that i want to take some action on. Has anyone else had a slip and fall and can't get anyone to act on your report and contact you to investigate and respond to it? And where  you DID MAKE  a number of reports of the incident in email AND on website a number of times and like all the  reports here on this page  complaining about Airbnb's terrible customer service they claim they will help you get it handled and no one ever does? 

With my issue...a slip and fall .... NO FOLLOW UPS IN A CALL OR EMAIL TO FOLLOW UP ON IT....... and i believe the host is simply not FORWARDING HER OWN REPORT AS SHE IS REQUIRED TO  because she does not want it to be acted on.

 So is a class action lawsuit in order? Is this business just too big for anyone to be willing to take them on? Are you someone who has that or similar kind of incident (slip and fall) or other serious issue that has to be resolved and no one is doing it?

It's been since mid Sept and they just say be patient but i know ..because i read other reviews and see how they handled other peoples VERY VALID issues ...they DIDN'T 
AND THEN SAID LATER IT IS TOO LATE OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN...HOW CORRUPT IS THAT? AND HOW IS THAT OCCURRING WITHOUT ANY ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THEM FOR THAT? THAT IS CRIMINAL TO IGNORE A COMPLAINT FOR A SLIP AND FALL . a HUGE LEGAL VIOLATION OF RIGHTS AND HUMAN MORALITY.  this is disgusting . 
The Numbers of reports i put in on line and in email and assured by their hardly able to speak and understand English customer service reps who do just read scripts and only say things over and over as told to "" We are sorry this happened and we assure you someone will contact you. Just be patient. We cannot help you . only the third party who handles these can. "" EAch one says that and i ask...how i can find out if MY REPORT  even got sent to the third party? (""...they don't know and they can't do anything about it but they will forward it to a special team that can""....is what they say next and then the special team closes the case and never says or does anything about your inquiry as to if it was forwarded and who to ) I also ask for the name of that co. (which i think it is illegal to withhold and especially if after 3.5 months nothing happened yet...they must have to tell who is handling it an give you a name and contact info...but i ask and they all say no we don't have that info (and i believe that they don't but how does the Air bnb corporation get away with that and training their people to say that to those who pay highly for a stay in a bnb and that includes insurance for any accident ?and then they have no way to report it and know it is in hands of someone who is handling it and get no reply for months from THAT party and so virtually any one who has that experience has NO RECOURSE?
SO AIR bnb GET AWAY WITH NEVER PROCESSING ANY REPORTS OR CLAIMS?...IS THAT EVEN LEGAL??? iF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE WE SHOULD CONFER AND SEEK A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT  or something . Go very public too. AS THIS HAS TO BE ILLEGAL. AND FOR MORE THAN JUST IGNORING A CLAIM....AS THERE IS MORE THAN JUST NO ACTION ON IT ....THE KIND OF STRESS AND OTHER REPERCUSSIONS WHEN A HARD FALL AND ESPECIALLY BEING A SENIOR....IS ENOUGH TO ENDURE .. TO BE IGNORED AND CHEATED AND DISMISSED ARTFULLY BY HAVING YOUR EMPLOYEES JUST LIE TO YOU WITH CLAIMS THAT SOME THIRD PARTY WILL BE IN TOUCH AND THEY NEVER ARE IS WORSE THAN JUST IGNORING YOUR REPORT. AND ANY CLAIM  should be more than for just the amount of cost of issues involved after that kind of treatment ..which is undue harassment and intimidation in ways i am not mentioning here but encountered in trying to get more information and an honest and really responsible response from the host....who i do believe has not filed this and never even met me or saw me before or after the fall and should have to see the actual evidence and truth of my claim , and instead made uncalled for assumptions to avoid her own responsibility and outcomes with this. it's enough to fall and endure the pain and other consequences of that ...Where is the CONCERN AND DESIRE TO HELP a customer after that? KNOWING THAT ANY CLAIM INVOLVES CAREFUL AND  I N DEPTH SCRUTINY so it warrants that neither host or guest need to block the report. Especially this one which is if done timely & correctly is an easy  & rather minor resolve cost wise for recovery, where could and will be much more liability issue , if just ignore, try to intimidate or discourage the person from their rightful reporting of it & rightful consequences/ assessment if not done timely.PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS HERE OR LV MSG HERE IN ANY COMPLAINT FORM FOR HOW & IF CAN REACH YOU,  IF WANT TO CONFER ON a class action lawsuit."
2024-12-27,1,Tremendous decline in the last 4 years,"Tremendous decline in the last 4 years. I used to use Airbnb 4 years ago and it was a great booking site. If a place was available for your dates, you could reserve it and get an instant verification email. 
  Now, you can only ""request to book"" and the host has 24 HOURS to decide if they will accept. So far I've tried to book 3 or 4 different places only for the host to decline because their house was already booked. So why did Airbnb have it still listed as available?

2024-12-27,1,❌DISGUSTING❌,"Awful place, absolutely nothing like the description. It was that bad we couldn’t stay there and had to book a hotel instead! No response from owner or air bnb regarding refund. ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL. "
2024-12-27,1,pay to respond to host,"I have had bad experience with air bnb, I was processing a booking of $1,960 which gone up to 3,930, when I sent the host a message which was read by Airbnb, the answer was that the cost changes on demand which wasn’t my problem as I was in the middle of processing the payment.
Whats unfair is that you can only contact the host once, if you have another enquiry, or you want to respond you have to setup a payment method before you respond to him, and the reply tab gets replaced with “request to book” which if it reaches him, the payment gets debited from your card, 
Bottom line is, you can’t contact the host unless you pay.

2024-12-26,1, Warning About Reservations – Beware of Disappearing Bookings!,"I want to warn anyone planning to extend their stay at a hotel or rental property. Before I arrived, I made arrangements to extend my stay. Upon arrival, I was told that my reservation had been extended, but my original booking had disappeared. I received no information about the cancellation of my original reservation. Furthermore, I had to pay again for my original reservation because, allegedly, the funds from my first booking were used to extend my stay.

I never wanted to cancel my first reservation, only to extend it. However, on the day of my arrival, I found out that my original booking had been removed.

I recommend being cautious when making reservations, especially if you plan to change or extend them. Always ensure you have clear confirmation for any changes, and if there are any issues, contact the property before you arrive. Avoid situations where your original booking might suddenly ""disappear"" without prior notice and where you may have to pay again for something you've already paid for.

"
2024-12-26,1,Worst kind of “Welcome back”,"I have come back to Airbnb after hosting so many years starting ~2015, not professionally, but always providing the best experiences to guests and always having a super host status. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say I was to some extent a poster child of airbnb hosting - the real deal. That puts their soul into every home I built and I had the trust in this platform to help me let people live in my own home. 

Coming back, I feel I have been totally scammed. They are so cunning that they make instant booking turned on by default and hiding away this setting making it almost impossible to find. Extremely bad UI/UX. Easy to upload pics and they let you get away with putting a very minimum content on the listing itself, but then they try to get money from charging penalties over bookings that I ended up realising I had no control of. This is not what Airbnb was about. Airnbn was about protecting hosts and helping them offer a great experience to their guests. They penalised me +€200 for not being able to acommodate an instan booking with less than a day notice although I had prep time listed. On Christmas day. If this is mot a rip off, i don’t know what is. 
And I was silly not to listen to friends telling me to go to booking.com. At least they didn’t fake for years a “community-based mindset” only to surface as even worse. This is truly disapointing and it’s coming from a naive old-schooler who never considered would be put in the position to be so intentionally scammed. "
2024-12-26,1,Aribnb unfair resolution processes with lack of transparency and accountability ,"I had a disappointing experience with Airbnb's resolution process during a recent stay. The property had several unresolved maintenance issues, including a blocked sink and a malfunctioning shower. Despite this, the host later claimed damages for a laundry machine that failed during my stay. I firmly believe this malfunction was due to pre-existing conditions, not my actions.

Throughout the dispute, I requested the following from Airbnb:

Evidence of Responsibility: I asked for clear and specific proof that I caused the laundry machine malfunction. Airbnb referenced ""photos and documentation"" but did not provide any evidence directly linking me to the issue.

Cost Breakdown: I requested an itemized breakdown of the £69.80 charge, including repair invoices or assessments. This was not provided.

Consideration of Property Condition: I highlighted several unresolved issues at the property that indicated a lack of proper maintenance, which may have contributed to the malfunction. This broader context was not acknowledged in Airbnb's decision.

Transparency in Decision-Making: I sought a detailed explanation of how the decision was reached, but the response relied primarily on the absence of prior complaints about the laundry machine, which does not constitute evidence.

Unfortunately, these reasonable requests were not addressed, and the resolution process did not meet the standard of fairness or transparency I expected. Guests should not be held liable for issues stemming from poor property maintenance. I hope Airbnb improves its process to ensure future decisions are more balanced and evidence-based.

Below is the only explanation I received from Airbnb:

""After a thorough review of all the evidence and factors, we have checked with the previous reservations and found out that there were no reported issues about the laundry machine before and after the reservation. During your stay, the machine had been working during the 1st use as mentioned by you as well. Under these conditions whenever there is an internal error the machines will provide error codes which wasn’t the situation in your case. We request you to provide any evidence showing that the damage was not caused by you so that we can reconsider the claim.""

This response lacks both evidence and accountability. It relies solely on the absence of prior complaints rather than addressing the broader issues or the host’s responsibility for maintaining the property. I expected a fairer and more transparent resolution process from Airbnb."

We were left to our own devices with no assistance from host 
Called Airbnb and no help given to rebook and no offer of compensation. We were left with a ruined Christmas holiday. Had to find new accommodation myself that was significantly more expensive. Airbnb after 2 days of dealing with them offered a fraction of my additional cost as a voucher to use with them for the future. I’m still about 1000$ out of pocket and they don’t care. 
They imposed a fine on the host for not honour the booking but was planning on keeping the money for themselves and let me have all the additional costs. Had to find a hotel the first night and Airbnb promised to repay me for it but now they are saying they will try to get approval to do so. Can’t trust the company at all. 
If you book with Airbnb on peak travel dates and popular destinations then if you encounter any problems you’re on your own. What could have been a reasonably priced vacation can quickly become very expensive if the host cancels or changes their mind. "

The worst customer service ever, they have bot replies they spam you with. They dont read or look at what you sent them.  Nothing they send is related to your case what so ever, just a pure waste of time. We opened a legal case now as its way too obvious what they did in our case, confirmed compensation and didnt pay to keep the booking going.  Keeping us warm with nonsense bot replies and declining any support. Absolutely disgusting and obviously ruined our stay.

Each time I contact a representative, I am informed that my case will be assigned to a specialist. However, the specialists consistently provide generic, incorrect, or incomplete responses. This has resulted in a significant waste of my time dealing with unhelpful Airbnb representatives.
Additionally, one of my claims was closed without any prior notification or explanation.

I have noticed a trend that certain ""hosts"" delete the profile for their accommodation when they get a negative review then just re-list the same accommodation under a new profile to start building up positive reviews. One company which has several airbnb's in Manchester has done this several times.

Airbnb should prevent this from happening as otherwise people will spend their money on accommodation which appears okay but they are potentially going to have issues. "

I’ve never received better customer support than I did from this interaction, super fast reply’s, very nice and helpful and he managed to give me a full refund to my surprise.

2024-12-20,2,"Discrepant location X Hard to cancel, get refund","Before heading to the apartment, I entered the full address in the maps app just to find out a discrepancy in geographic location from the advertised location on Airbnb.

Please cancel my reservation and provide full refund. See attached maps of the discrepancy between advertised and real location

Location incorrect. By clicking on the Airbnb location provided in the Airbnb app, the app redirects to a Google map address at  20°15'36.4""'S 40°16'00.6""W coordinates which corresponds to address  R. Elzira Vivacqua, 699-583 - Jardim Camburi, Vitória - ES, 29090-350, Brazil. 
The owner provided location is 0.4 mile (699 meters) away. This is a huge issue because I booked and paid only to be at the coordinates exact location as I'm visiting to assist my mom at the same block of the coordinates provide by your app.
In sum, the issue may have been the Airbnb geographic location app or the property owner trying to upsell the listing by locating the property closer to the ocean.

2024-12-20,1,Hidden Camera in Our Bedroom—Airbnb Ignored It and Punished Us for Speaking Out,"I discovered a hidden, tampered lens in the bedroom shared by me and my girlfriend overlooking the bed we were sleeping in during our stay at an Airbnb property. Concerned for our safety and privacy, I immediately reported this to Airbnb and asked for their assistance. Their response was to send a message to the host, who then turned around and sent me aggressive, intimidating messages about me messaging Airbnb. That was the extent of Airbnb’s “support.”

As if that weren’t bad enough, Airbnb allowed the host to leave a misleading, slanderous review accusing me of breaking house rules (the apparent rule he created to not contact Airbnb.....) instead of addressing the actual issue. Despite my attempts to have Airbnb acknowledge the gravity of the situation—particularly that women’s safety was put at risk—they have simply ignored the aggressive messages, done nothing to remove the bias slanderous review, and made it clear they do not plan to act.

What’s worse is that the property is likely still available on Airbnb’s platform, and the hidden lens has probably just been moved or disguised further. This means other guests could also unknowingly have their safety and privacy violated.

This experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. When a company can’t be trusted to handle genuine safety concerns, especially those involving potential violations of privacy, it’s a red flag for anyone who values their well-being and safety. Based on what happened to me and my girlfriend, along with similar experiences reported by others, I would strongly advise against using Airbnb. They have shown that they will neither protect you nor take action when it truly matters."

We spent three exhausting hours with customer service trying to understand what happened, but they gave no clear reason for the cancellation or the account restrictions. This last-minute disruption caused us so much stress and almost ruined our trip.

Airbnb’s lack of transparency, accountability, and care for their customers is unacceptable. If you’re looking for a reliable platform for group travel, I suggest you look elsewhere.

That guest had used Airbnb for the first time ever compared to me being a host and guest for years. Regardless, Airbnb banned me as a host and guest permanently without even calling me to hear from me. Literally, just a few hours after the report. Even when I appealed, I received no contact by then to talk to me but instead they just kept sending me an automated email saying that after careful consideration they decided to proceed with their initial decision. Totally embarrassing treatment to a valuable partner (according to them), as they have told me many times by offering me free professional photographer, 100$ to use as a guest and the badges of distinction for one of my listings.

At one point, they even called me in the middle of the night, adding to the stress instead of helping. I was forced to leave the property due to safety concerns, but Airbnb refuses to issue a refund, claiming it’s “host discretion”—even though the host is the one at fault here.

2024-12-13,1,My identity was stolen and thousands of…,"My identity was stolen and thousands of pounds worth of airbnb stays booked with my card. Airbnb were unhelpful, with so many security hoops to jump through that they wouldn't cancel the booking, or alert the hosts of the stay that criminals were in their properties. However, clearly not enough security to stop someone creating a fake account and using a stolen card."
2024-12-13,1,Absolutely disrespectful company,"Absolutely disrespectful company! They do nothing to protect their clients from dishonest hosts. 

Just a little over a month ago, we gathered in Virginia. Our friend rented a large cabin by the lakeside to ensure we had as much comfort as possible. We are all of different ages, ranging from 30 to almost 60—mature and respectful people from middle class and higher—who came together from various states: Utah, California, Illinois. We enjoyed our time together, grilling and listening to our husbands play guitar by the fireplace. We were so happy to see each other that we didn’t pay much attention to the small broken things, like the toilet handle or spots on the carpet. How foolish of us!

After we moved out, we left an excellent review for the property, and the host immediately responded with a five-star review, mentioning that we had been great guests and left the house in good condition. However, a day later, he claimed there were numerous damages: vomiting, a broken mirror, a clogged dishwasher, and more. He attached a photo of the mirror with a crack, but we found the same cracked mirror in his listing photos on Airbnb. He pointed out every small spot on the carpet, bedding, and towels, attributing them to normal human activity like taking a shower or sleeping. None of these issues showed any signs of vomiting or significant damage.

He estimated the damages to be around $1,300, and the Airbnb team accepted this claim and is planning to charge our friend. She has repeatedly asked for details about how they conducted their investigation, but she has been ignored and left without any explanation.

People, please, never use this service. 
 You are not protected from false accusations, and they will charge you as much as they want."
2024-12-12,1,We rented a filthy house from a host in…,"We rented a filthy house from a host in Mauritius named Amelie, the pool was dirty. The dishwasher was broken, the house smelled,  the toaster didnt work.
There were lots of issues, in the end we apparently left makeup on a pillow case and sheet and were being charged £40 to clean them, they were cheap ones anyway. Plus the Airbnb terms said cleaning was included in the cost.
It was a horrible stay.
Since then we reviewed the property, Air bnb allowed her to delete the review but she was able to leave a personal one on our Airbnb page.
Now we were ill with folliculitus from the dirty pool which was cleaned 2 days into our stay. 
I didnt even bother bringing that up even though we have the WhatsApp messages. 

Finally she accused us of blackmail,  Airbnb can read all the messages so they know its not true.
Finally,  she was able to get a friend to leave a fake review during our period of stay which Air bnb have allowed.
Absolute scam.
We had people leave sick, pooh and food on the walls and we never did this 
Reviews must be unbiased, as im neuro divergent this has made me very ill.
Very bad. booking.com is much better."
2024-12-12,1,Very unpleasant experience with Airbnb,"I am saddened to write this but I have no other choice. I’ve been treated most poorly by the Airbnb team. 

A few months ago I booked a cabin by the lake in Virginia for my friends and family. All we wanted is to grill and use the hot tub, which we did and had a great time in the house. The house seemed fine to me, I don’t pay attention to tiny details as I am there to relax and not to do a full inspection. 

After we checked out, I left a 5 star review to the host, and then later the host gave me a 5 star review and mentioned we left the house in great condition. After that, reviews can’t be changed. 

A few hours later the host is writing to me saying we destroyed the house. He falsely accused me and my friends and family of vomiting all around the place (we did not and he didn’t provide any proof of that), destroying a fridge, breaking a mirror, clogging a dishwasher, etc etc etc. I had a belief that you only take pictures of the house if it’s really damaged, and since the house looked fine, I didn’t take any pictures. How wrong was I. 

The interesting part is that I looked up the Airbnb posting of the same house and also I found it on Zillow. The mirror that the host is claiming I broke - well, it was broken before. That same crack is in the pictures on the Airbnb posting and the host bought the house with that same crack in 2022. While I don’t have pictures of all the accusations that the host is putting on me, I believe this is a strong enough evidence that proves i am being taken advantage of. 

I also found a picture of the fridge - the fridge looks perfect and no dents there. I provided a receipt dated a day before the trip that includes disposable dishes to prove that we didn’t use the dishwasher (which we really didn't). The answer from the Airbnb team is outrageous - we are not taking this evidence because you didn’t take pictures. How on earth am I supposed to take pictures of a dishwasher to prove I didn’t clog it? Why is the picture of the bathroom that has the same crack on the mirror (even the same shape) not legit evidence and why would a picture that I made be more valuable? And finally, why the picture of the fridge that I have is not acceptable? It’s a picture, just like you asked. 

The customer service is just stalling me and making me wait, 2 weeks with no response, and the supposed date of the charge is coming up. I have said a dozen of times that I am not authorizing the charge until I see explanation why my evidence is inadmissible as well as asking the host to provide pictures ‘before’ the damages that he’s accusing me of. No response on that.

Needless to say that after such a disappointing experience and how I’ve been treated by the customer support team, never in my life will I ever use the Airbnb services. "

2024-12-12,1,No refund received ,"Owed a refund for cancelling a booking and have been waiting since beginning of November, I have been told 3 times it's been sent on 3 occasions and still no sign of it, I have opened up a dispute with my bank who have been amazing."
2024-12-11,1,Airbnb has an awful customer service,"Airbnb has an awful customer service. You could end up in a very unsafe situation because they advertised a dodgy place and they will not look after you . I booked a place that was disgusting beyond belief . Old dirty tampons in the bathroom , cat in the flat , dirty bed , underwear on the floor , generally filthy , cluttered and  untidy , front door broken , chewing gums stuck in lamp shade , honestly I can go on , filthy beyond comprehension. I arrived in that filth at midnight on a stormy day in London . Airbnb was just awful to look after me . First they tell you to resolve it with the host but that would put you directly in danger . How can such filthy person sort something like that ? They could send people and put you in danger for complaining . There is nothing someone like that can do to help . So then after arguing for a while and they saw all the evidence , airbnb offer you only a refund !!!? It is 1 am in a stormy night and they think a refund is acceptable . They don’t try to find an alternative accommodation and  they put the responsibility on you . I had to argue for two hours and had to book a £320 a night room which was really worth £120 but nothing else was available. At the end after losing my sanity for 2 hours at 2 am I managed to get £156 from them but this is my opinion is unacceptable . I know now that if you are in danger and they sent you to a filthy unsafe place Airbnb has no policy to help you and sort you out . You will be left stranded . It is disgusting . I wish I could show you pictures of this filthy place . They still have not removed it from their website . Unbelievable . I am going to put a video on YouTube to show you that filth and for people to know what can happen with Airbnb . They are happy to take millions but with zero customer service . "
2024-12-11,1,Loved Airbnb back in the day. It is Now a Scam,"Booked a 6-day stay due to a family emergency.  We were on the road for hours, and noticed a voice mail.  Listened to VM and the ""host"" said they cancelled the booking.  When I called back, they actually attempted to blame me as they said they sent messages via Airbnb and called many times (LIED). I tried 6 times to re-book another accommodation with Airbnb as a passanger in the car going 80,  but it would not go through.  This was because the original scammer ""host"" did not officially cancel.  Nice, right?!  Called customer service to rebook another nearby apartment, rather than using the fnon-functioning online interface.  Hello India!  Could not understand their ""English"".  After many attempts to make them aware of the horrid situation the orginal ""host "" put me in, they placed me on multiple long holds to check with their ""supervisor"". Finally, when I thought all was ready to be rebooked, they told me they were going to call the original ""host/scammer"" to confirm that they would accept MY cancellation and I needed to call back.  I freaked out on them (admittedly) and told them their company was a bunch of assholes.  I now have a warning that ""Moving forward, we won‘t be able to offer support without these needs being met. It's important to note that repeat instances of this kind may result in the removal of your Account from the Airbnb platform. This is in line with our Terms of Service and our standards and expectations.""  I checked my emails.  I have 7 different messages confirming and CANCELLING the original booking.  Confusing much?!!!  say to them F*&3 u.  I approve this message."

The Airb&b is orientated towards rating poorly the customers, who complain about substandard accommodation, allowing the landlords to leave bad reviews about money paying guests, while removing the critical reviews from the guests, left for the landlords accounts.  In that respect the accommodation would appear suitable , while it falls severely short of the standards of hospitality business.

2024-12-09,1,"If you complain about customer service, Airbnb blocks further bookings","Host - if you complain about customer service they alter the algorithm so you stop getting bookings. The most appealing customer service that is outsourced to people who cannot comprehend English and use generic scripting. As soon as you challenge their scripted answers, they close the case. It’s a scam to not allow a complaint to escalate. This is what a Senior Case Manager, Rhea, wrote back to me when I asked for a matter to be escalated beyond Senior Case Management level: 

- “By the way this is Rhea one of the Senior case manager here in Airbnb

That's the reason why I coordinated with you yesterday after I received the escalated case for me to further assist.

I found your case with Shivam this case was created December 04, 2024 this case was close due to no response and no concern has been shared from you, here in Airbnb if the case has no progress or response from the Guest or Host we will set deadline for 24-48hours for you to share your concern and to response if not then we will close the case to cater other case. 

Please do note that since the case was assigned to me, you can't speak back to the previous senior case manager or ambassador that you want to speak with.

Based on your conversation with Jeet the case has been close due to they tried to call you for the agreed time but unable to reached you and since the case was no concern has been shared Jeet close the case.

I do respect your point of view on how you feel or find the customer service in UK as well as your stories and all the case was documented here on our end as well as the conversation for reference.

Furthermore, I am hoping to have your response for me to further assist.

I wanted to acknowledge that you've had a chance to read my previous message. Thank you for taking the time to do so. I genuinely appreciate your attention.

I completely understand that you might have numerous other commitments and priorities at the moment. Your time is valuable, and I respect that. Please know that I don't want to cause any disruption or inconvenience.

With that being said, I will go ahead and close this case, and you may contact us through this number 1-844-234-2500, I'm hoping that you can speak with Airbnb Public Relations in Dublin, Ireland ambassador for you to share your concern and for us to further assist you.

Apologies Lyle that you feel we are messing around but believe me that's not our intention we are here to help.” - 

They say they give one 24-48 hours to respond however that is not true as they close the cases before you get a chance to respond. They message and call you in the European early hours of the morning such as 0200 as they are outsourced in Asia, and before you wake up to read a message, they have closed it. 

It’s blatantly clear that AI or ChatGPT is used to construct these conversations 

So as long as the money is pouring into their accounts from you hosting and opening your home to strangers, they will support you and you will receive a plenitude of bookings. However as soon as you call for assistance because their single guest has arrived at your home with 2 more unsolicited people who all try to share a bed, Airbnb Superhost and Security support, do not know what to do and they ignore you. As soon as you lodge a complaint about them, the bookings stop. I have evidence of this. I have been an Airbnb host for over 10 years and until the pandemic, the customer support was from the IS or Ireland and was superb. It’s since been outsourced elsewhere and the customer service is diabolical. It’s become too big and they don’t care about the host’s safety anymore. It’s just about them making money. 
It’s sad how such a fine brand as Airbnb is being destroyed by employing cheap staff. "

I reported to airbnb beforehand that the landlord was not communicating for days beforehand. 

While this was the case, Airbnb refused to refund me and put the landlord first. A landlord who upon checking had similar reviews from other customers too.

2024-12-06,1,The entire review process is a joke,"The entire review process is a joke. Guests are told 4-stars is 'very good' yet then Airbnb uses that 4-star review to remove your guest favourite and superhost status...4-stars is not very-good, it's very stupid.  Subjective reviews by guests should not dictate the status of a host's result in search. "
2024-12-06,1,Airbnb hosts (& guests)…BEWARE,"

I am writing this review to inform current and future Airbnb clients about how it penalises its 'valued' hosts. I have been a host for at least five years and earned the title'superhost'. I have been relatively satisfied with their level of service, and despite the increase in the percentage they retain from the total guest payout (almost 20% now) I have remained loyal to the company. This year, however, I have realised that the company's policies are driven by profitability to the detriment of the individual host (and guests).
In May, through no fault of mine, the WiFi went down in my rental the evening before a guest was due. Having contacted my internet provider I was informed that the fault would require an engineer visit and could not be rectified for several days. My initial concern was for my guest, who needed this facility during their break. I informed the guest, who was extremely grateful for my care in the matter and requested a refund so they could find another lodging with WiFi. I explained that despite my 'strict cancellation policy' I would accept their cancellation and forego the payout. Airbnb phoned me immediately asking for verification of events, which I provided. They then informed me that I would be fined in excess of £180 and that my 'Superhost' title would be withdrawn. I was stunned! I was being penalised for considering a guest's needs and comfort before my own ! An Airbnb 'ambassador' explained that I had failed to provide one of the services that was in my listing, therefore the fault was mine!
The obvious result of this aggressive treatment of their hosts (who, after all, they are wholly reliant on) is that issues will not be reported to guests. Clearly, this tactic works....who in their right mind would knowingly put themselves at risk of being fined almost £200? Ultimately the guest suffers. This is borne out by the number of poor reviews here.
What a pity that there is no room in Airbnb's policies for compassion and understanding, or even simple humanity.

2024-12-05,1,Concerns Regarding Host Treatment and Platform Policies,"
To Airbnb Team,

I am writing to express serious concerns regarding the way I have been treated as a host on your platform. Recent experiences have raised critical issues that I believe need immediate attention and resolution.

1. Targeted Actions and Unjust Surveillance:
I have noticed a pattern where my account appears to be under excessive scrutiny. Reservations have been cancelled without prior notification to me or my guests, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Additionally, it feels as though my communications with guests are being excessively monitored, leading to further distrust.


2. Listing Management Issues:
On multiple occasions, my listings have been removed or suspended during the night, leaving me completely defenseless. This not only impacts my business but also affects the trust and convenience of my guests.


3. Inconsistent Hosting Requirements:
There is a lack of consistency in how I am expected to manage bookings. For instance, some days guests can book instantly and are provided with check-in instructions automatically, while on other days, I must manually handle every step. This inconsistency is highly disruptive and creates unnecessary workload, especially during peak hours.


4. Unresolved Financial Discrepancies:
Specific financial matters remain unresolved. For instance:

I paid for guests reservations out of my pocket and have yet to receive reimbursement.




These situations undermine my confidence in the fairness and transparency of Airbnb's processes.

I have always strived to uphold the highest standards as a host and to ensure that my guests have a positive experience. However, the challenges I am facing due to the platform's actions and policies are making it increasingly difficult to continue hosting effectively.
Very disappointing for you have yet to pay me a few thousand dollars.

2024-12-05,1,My father recently passed away and I…,"My father recently passed away and I tried to cancel my booking. I reached out to the host and they understood and also attempted to file a claim on our behalf to cancel the trip.

After talking (mostly waiting) for 2 hours with support, they told me that my trip could not be refunded and said they were ""sorry"".

There is nothing in the policy outlining the time line or conditions of a family member passing and they provided no reason why except it couldn't be honored.

This is a heartless and terrible company and they deserve nothing but the worst. They must not know loss of family and only care about taking your money.

Never using them again."
2024-12-05,1,Airbnb cancelled my reservation and…,Airbnb cancelled my reservation and stated that it was I that initiated the cancellation!!! Very passive aggressive with direct names and finger pointing ‘you’ they post and then close the case so you can’t even respond. Now I have no accommodation for my wedding 
2024-12-04,1,The most stupid website ever,The most stupid website ever 
2024-12-04,1,Blatant review fiddling ,"It's extremely manipulative to have a review system when AirBnB then let hosts blatantly fiddle the system by lying to get any bad reviews taken down. I'm sure they know this, but I'm also sure it's quite lucrative for both them and the hosts to give an artificially positive veneer to the platform. 

In my experience the hosts are remarkably dodgy, and I really don't recommend using AirBnB. "
2024-12-04,1,Hosts pay to remove negative reviews,I just found out that Airbnb hosts can pay to have negative reviews removed. No wonder we are completed blindsided by subpar units and hosts. I had a miserable experience during my last stay and my review was taken down without my consent or knowledge. 
2024-12-03,1,Their service fee is cheaper before…,"Their service fee is cheaper before logging in the system, it is more expensive by logging in which they couldn't provide a legitimate reason.

The hosts are very pleasant and will do anything to make your stay a pleasant one. Nothing is to much trouble for them."
2024-12-03,1,Charges taxes even if you have residence,"I have a work permit for Malaysia, and the website charges tax , Agoda and booking.com allow you to put yourself down as Malaysian and confirm with your passport and documents on arrival. Everything on airbnb is essentially charging me an extra 10% in tourist taxes. Which I am not liable to pay. Malaysians still have to pay a tourist tax on air bnb . Ironically making Agoda cheaper than Airbnb for longterm stays. Seems dumb that they have priced themselves out of the market, by charging extra funds , they don’t receive themselves and their customers aren’t liable to pay."
2024-12-02,1,If you want your holiday ruined chose airbnb.,"Airbnb ruined my holiday with their countless emails from a host asking £1,250 for the door lock that was broken before I arrive. Not only that, airbnb keeps emailing me if you still want to pay all or part of the money host requested let us know. WHY? WHY? Why should I want that? While I was innocent and this host wanted to abuse an innocent, the host never even asked me once did you break the door. He even apologized for all the troubles. Airbnb has created a platform to let hosts abuse and insult you in any wany they want, and assume you are guilty."
2024-12-02,1,Airbnb is a nightmare,I initially reserved with a host inn December 2024. I had to cancel the trip due to Hurricane Milton. The host would give me a refund or offer any alternative dates. I submitted a dispute with my credit card which was denied. After contacting Consumer Protection Bureau I received an email from Airbnb stating I would receive a refund but the refund was not posted to my card. I contacted Airbnb to check the status and was told they could not refund me due to the dispute which had already been denied/closed and a charge reposted to my account. It's now December and trying to get a refund has been a nightmare and I will never use airbnb again.

They agreed to reprotect me on a different listing, i had to pay the difference in price.
By the time they processed the refund the new listing was gone and i got stranded in the middle of a foreign city with no place to sleep.
The support totally incompetent and unable to find a decent place where i could find accommodation.
As of now i do not know where i would sleep tonight.

2024-12-02,1,Complete Disregard for Women's Safety - Unannounced Entry from Peacock Bungalow's Handyman,"I stayed at an Airbnb in San Diego and the owner's contempt, Peacock Bungalows,  for safety was very dangerous.

Without any consent, they had a handyman come into the apartment while I was not fully dressed in the morning to replace a lightbulb. ""Angela"", as this company calls themselves on airbnb, had only messaged me thirty minutes earlier asking if he could come into the apartment.

I never saw this message until he was around ten feet away from me.

He came in without knocking or announcing himself and told me he had express permission to come in whenever as authorized by Peacock Bungalows. For non-emergency repairs, this is completely illegal. As a single woman I was very concerned as I had no idea who this person was or why he was in my apartment and felt worried about my safety. He turned out to be friendly, but the fact that he was able to enter the apartment without any notice (not even knocking) is a huge concern for any woman's safety.

When I told people at Peacock Bungalow what had happened as the handyman was still in the apartment, I asked them to please have someone knock before they come in for safety.

They never responded to that question which tells you everything you need to know about them. More so, I luckily was able to leave the apartment early from airbnb due to what happened and, ""Angela"" accused me of just contacting Airbnb for a refund to get out of a cancellation fee.

Her review of me was disgusting. I had absolutely real concern to have a grown man come into my room by myself, as many woman have had experiences where that dynamic could go awful extremely quickly. 

I was very upset to see this accusation from this company, but am more disappointed that airbnb viewed this review as just being their opinion when I had screenshots verifying that I had expressed my concerns to, ""Angela"" while the handyman was still in my apartment, even though they accused me of only bringing up concerns about consent later.

Peacock Bungalows broke the law, putting my safety at risk while I paid a premium to stay at their apartment, and then slandered my intentions about wanting to leave summing it up to greed. It doesn't get much lower, but I guess that's their opinion, right?

The last straw was when I was told I had to disconnect and remove my security system cameras in the common areas of the house.  My homeowner insurance provided a discount for having the security system in place.  Airbnb did not approve of my security system so I was forced to close the account.      Airbnb is a totalitarian system.  I will never ever use them again. 
2024-11-28,1,I had a terrible experience with Airbnb and lost a significant amount of money due to their inflexible cancellation policy.,"I recently had a distressing experience with Airbnb, where I canceled a booking within their advertised 48-hour grace period due to discovering the unit was pet-friendly—a severe issue for my family, who have allergies. Airbnb claimed I canceled at 49 hours and denied a full refund, even though I provided evidence and valid reasons.
	The host kept over 41,000 THB ($1,140 USD), Airbnb retained 20,000 THB ($555 USD), and I was left with only a partial refund of 15,187.66 THB (~$420 USD). Worse, the host initially communicated with me outside the platform and offered private discounts, which violates Airbnb’s own policies.
	Airbnb needs to address these failures. Suggestions:
		•	Provide clear countdown warnings for cancellation windows.
	•	Restrict hosts to one listing per property to prevent review manipulation.
	•	Conduct periodic checks to ensure listings are accurate.
	As a loyal customer, this experience has shaken my faith in the platform. I hope Airbnb prioritizes fairness and accountability for guests moving forward."
2024-11-28,1,Airbnb is a Waste of Time – Hosts Only Care About Long Stays!,"I am beyond frustrated with Airbnb! I tried to book 11 different properties in Phuket for a stay between 18 December and 4 January, and every single booking was cancelled. Why? Because the hosts are apparently only interested in people booking for longer periods!

This has been an absolute nightmare. I’ve wasted hours of my time sending booking requests, only to have them declined or canceled with excuses that they want someone to stay longer. If your platform allows this kind of behavior, why even bother letting people list shorter stays?

Airbnb, you need to hold your hosts accountable for these kinds of practices. It’s incredibly unfair to customers and makes using your platform a complete waste of time and energy.

This experience has left me with zero trust in Airbnb for future bookings, especially during peak travel seasons. Step up your game, Airbnb, or you’ll lose loyal users like me!"
2024-11-26,1,Denied an account for 20 year old background.,"I have never used them before but I have rented places from other websites for over 15 years. So I go to use airbnb finally and booked a stay and paid for everything. 10 mins later I get an email about needing to verify who I am and to upload my DL. Which is fine so I do. About another 20 mins later they cancel my trip and suspend my account for a 20 year old background after they do a background check. Now keep in mind my last offense was 20 years ago. I have been at the same job for 15 years, have bought houses and sold houses, I have probably 30 credit cards, and over an 800 credit score, and the house I own now is worth more than the house I was trying to rent. But because of a marijuana charge 20 years ago airbnb thanks they are too good for me. Even though me and my wife have rented cabins, houses and hotels for years and most try to get my business because I do good business. So if you have a background than I would take your business elsewhere just on principle. I canceled my account and will not NO MATTER WHAT give airbnb a dime of my money and by the reviews I should not have tried to use them in the first place. By the way I tried to appeal it and see if airbnb would try to do anything but they did not, they said it would take up to 7 days to get back to me and I still have not heard anything in 14 days, so they do not care."

A guest flooded my bathroom with water pouring through the ceiling. I was told on the phone this would be covered by air b and b protection service and to cancel and refund the guest staying. They blamed me saying it was due to the design of my bathroom and a pre-existing problem (despite the previous guest staying for 3 months with no problems). They then closed the case leaving me out of pocket for the guest who had to leave early due to a none functioning bathroom, the bills to redecorate due to the water damage and the cancelled next guest. This has cost me over £1000. The service has been appalling. "

To cut along story short, never got into the property, spend over 4 hrs and about 8 phonecalls to air bnb, getting sent around the house.  They wouldn't pay for another property for me and I had to fight with them for over 4 hrs.  Wasted my whole evening on the phone to them.  It was like talking to ""Computer says No"".

This essentially enables retaliation and undermines the integrity of the review system. As a guest, I received a positive review for being clean and respectful, but after leaving honest negative feedback about the host’s poor behavior, their review about me was deleted. It’s disappointing that AirBnB supports a policy that discourages honest feedback by letting hosts punish guests in this way.
Don't use this platform.  Dirty Policy.  They even removed my negative review to the host without an explanation.  Money talks"

2024-11-24,1,Airbnb Has Lost Its Mission: A Personal Review,"When Airbnb launched over a decade ago, it was a revolutionary idea. A platform offering something different from the sterile, impersonal listings of traditional booking sites. Cozy homes, personalized experiences, and human connection—it was the antidote to cookie-cutter hotels.  

Back then, as a loyal supporter, I couldn't have imagined how far the platform could stray from its original values. But as companies grow, processes evolve, and bureaucracy takes over, it seems Airbnb has lost sight of the very essence that made it special: quality and trust.  

A Summer to Forget: My Airbnb Experience

Last summer, my family and I rented a house in Montenegro for 30 days through Airbnb. Montenegro itself is stunning—a country full of charm, incredible food, and warm people. But our stay? It was ruined by Airbnb's failure to uphold its promises.  

Let me paint a picture of what we endured:  

- The ""Full Kitchen"" That Wasn’t:  
We arrived to find a ""full kitchen"" that lacked basic utensils. A pan? Nowhere to be found. We had to buy one just to cook. This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s misrepresentation.  

- The Leaking Washing Machine:
With two kids, we needed a working washing machine. On the second day, it started leaking water all over the floor. The host, initially unresponsive, eventually sent a plumber, but the issue persisted. Every three days, we spent two hours wiping water off the floor during a washing cycle. Instead of enjoying our holiday, we became janitors.  

- Centipede Invasion:
Giant centipedes (yes, the terrifying *Scolopendra galapagoensis*) found their way into the house at night. Sleep became impossible as we spent sleepless nights guarding the kids' room and scouring the house for these creatures. The host’s response? “That’s normal near the forest.” Normal?! After seeing one of the massive centipedes, even he admitted it was unusual. We had to buy poison ourselves, but the problem never fully went away.  

- A Misleading “Pet-Friendly” Label:  
We chose this listing partly because it was labeled as pet-friendly. Imagine our shock when the host threatened to shoot stray dogs that wandered onto the property. Pet-friendly? Hardly.  

The Final Insult: Airbnb's Resolution Center Failure  

After all this, the host demanded €120 for a ""damaged mattress."" The mattress was already damaged when we arrived, but that didn’t stop him. Airbnb’s Resolution Center? Useless. Their system, which is supposed to mediate disputes, completely ignored the issues we raised. Instead, they sided with the host, forcing us to waste countless hours answering redundant questions and fighting a one-sided battle.  

When I countered with a claim for €1,250 to cover our ruined experience, Airbnb responded with a robotic message: ""Our policies do not allow us to fulfill your request."" Policies? What about their responsibility to verify the host's claims or ensure guest safety?  

A Lost Vision for Airbnb

This isn’t just a complaint about a bad stay—it’s a wake-up call. Airbnb has buried its user-friendly ethos under layers of soulless protocols. Their policies prioritize bureaucracy over humanity, ignoring the safety and well-being of families like mine.  

This Airbnb review highlights how far the platform has strayed from its mission of trust and connection. If they can’t protect their users or enforce basic standards, what’s left of the platform's promise?  

To Airbnb, I extend my condolences for losing sight of your higher mission. Your users deserved better, and now, many of us are questioning why we ever trusted you in the first place.

2024-11-23,3,"Reviews by guests, lots of lies","
I have loved Airbnb on the whole it is just the review system that has ruined it for me.
The review system is ridiculous for hosts. There are nasty people, con artists, or guests just looking to get a refund by lying about the condition, so it stands to reason that at some point, these people will leave bad reviews, and there is nothing you as a host can do about it. Plus, I had 15 5 stars in a row, and my overall score did not change. One bad review, and you are down a point. Most guests were fine but some I considered sueing for defamation. I am Leaving Airbnb soon for the above reasons.
Also, one guest gave us a 5 for all areas but a 4 overall when questioned he said 'I never give a 5 to anyone' so we get marked down for that nonsense!!!"
2024-11-23,1,"Have been a Airbnb customer for years, but never again","Have been a Airbnb customer for years.  Everything was wonderful until a host violated the law AND left gross hairs on the bathroom floor and AIRBNB claimed to do an investigation, yet nothing came of it, after I spent many hours going back and forth with them.  In time, enough people will realize the owners are simply greedy capitalists who simply don’t care about people, but instead, just the size of their bank accounts.  They represent all that’s wrong with America these days. "

Unresponsive support, unaddressed host blackmail, and lack of resolution despite evidence. Unreliable and untrustworthy. Prioritizes profits over guest well-being. Disappointing experience"
2024-11-22,1,Defamation of character from a host…,"Defamation of character from a host that Airbnb never resolved. Airbnb behaved in a very untrustworthy way, hence the Trust Pilot review about this company based on Airbnb’s appalling behaviour. A host in Spain lied about both me and another user and host. Airbnb only seem to care about their own reputation and not that of their users when members when someone else lies about their conduct. Airbnb have been deliberately absent in resolving this issue and acted in very bad faith."
2024-11-21,1,Airbnb out of California,"Airbnb out of California, USA placed two fraudulent charges on my credit card. When contacted, twice they tried to claim that I shared my CC information with someone else. As a former JP Morgan Chase employee, I know more about credit card security than most people, not even my wife has my information. Beware of Airbnb charges on your credit card statements."
2024-11-21,1,Booked a place that did not look like…,Booked a place that did not look like it was advertised. I left and booked a hotel and asked the host for a refund. The host then contacted me and told me he would refund a portion if I agreed not to leave a review. They sent me their personal number and told me not to text thru the app. They said they would refund only if I agreed to their conditions and I had to text them direct to learn what they would be. I tried to contact Airbnb about it but there is nowhere on their site to report something like this.
2024-11-20,1,Avoid AirBnB at all cost,"I have seen tons of people were let down by Airbnb in here, 90% of Airbnb users here is not happy at all,  but have not seen a single response from Airbnb, they seem don't care at all.

I think I should jot down my the most recent experience with Airbnb. 

I have used this platform over 11years as a guest, paid over thousands for their service, they charge excessive fees now for booking, but customer service never match the fee they demand, indeed, I don't feel there is a proper customer service. 

I was asked to verify my ID first time as 11 years user, I uploaded my driving licence instantly, which is on the acceptable ID list, after waiting for more than 6 hours, no response, I called customer service for help, trying to secure and complete my booking. Can you imagine what happened next?

I was told, the system can't to recognise my face. I don't understand what it means! Please explain!  I asked, then I was told it needs a coloured photo, but have not ever seen a photo on driving license is in colour in the UK, truly shocked and speechless!
I shall delete my Airbnb account now and look for an alternative platform, will you?

2024-11-20,1,Airbnb customer support maybe the worst!,"We had been locked out of our Airbnb at night in a bad side of town with my wife and 3 & 5 year old daughters. The electronic door pad did not work and we could not contact the owner. We talked to 5 ""ambassadors"" a.k.a customer service reps from India. They promised us they would have the emergency department call us and they would send someone to open the door. We had to call back for several hours only to only be told the same thing. They kept using the excuse they were having a busy night. The Emergency department or any Airbnb department never contacted us and basically repeatedly said how they understood our frustration. They would actually never call us back and just sent a message the next day 15 hours later on how they were sorry they never responded. We also tried the help chat several times but they would not respond after we explained our issue. The only response they would give us again we understand your frustration. I worked over twenty years in customer service and this was the worst display of customer service I have been involved with. Me and my wife realized a few hours in there was going to be no help or call back to help us and our young children, they were lying to get us off the phone. Several hours later we personally contacted the host. I will tell anyone reading this the support is awful and no matter how Airbnb tries to spin it the ""ambassadors"" are useless and they hire cheap support who's main goal is to get you off the phone. We even had one of the ""ambassadors"" tell us he was going to go on very long break so we wont be able to contact him. Airbnb should be ashamed but then again- their biggest concern in getting everyone's money. "
2024-11-20,1,Truly terrible company,"Truly terrible company, tried to use them twice but never actually got to stay in a property. Both times have been cancelled once by the accommodation once by myself with refund period. Both times have had to fight tooth and nail to get my money back. Still fighting with the 2nd one the customer service assistant really is as much use as a chocolate fireguard with all responses being completely irrelevant to the situation. Was actually genuinely asked to write the loss of £500 to their incompetence as a one off bad experience and to come back and use them again soon. Zero chance of that happening."
2024-11-19,1,The second time my fully paid reservation was cancelled,The second time my fully paid few months ago reservation was cancelled. They told me that host cancelled my stay but that wasn't true. The host contacted me to ask if I'd like to book their apartment again because admin cancelled the reservation. Unfortunately this time the cost was 17% higher. Strongly do not recommend this service.
2024-11-19,2,As a host I will say that Airbnb…,"As a host I will say that Airbnb completely favours guests. We had a guy stay at our place and he completely trashed it. He left empty cocaine wraps ALL OVER the place, stumped out spliffs on the worktops and had broken multiple cupboard doors and furniture. He’d been smoking weed in our flat and the cleaners ended up charging us an extra £200 to get rid of the smell and to handle the drug paraphernalia. It also cost me over £400 in repairs. I sent photo evidence to Airbnb who were completely useless and they even stopped me being able to leave a review on the guys profile. I dread to think how many other people have ended up renting their places out to him so he can hold his drug parties there because of this. "
2024-11-19,1,Air BnB ,"I have been charged £222 for a property that I was made to pay before it was accepted by the owner, who within 5 mins said the property wasn’t available. That was nearly a week ago and that charge remains on my credit card, which is now at its limit so I can’t use it because you are unable to take the marker off the card. This company has got too big for its boots and has now become a rip off. No one to talk to regarding this issue.


Booking.com hotels.com etc are all now as efficient and do not charge the same costs. We will avoid using in the future."
2024-11-19,1,I'll never use Airbnb again.,"I booked an Airbnb.  They cancelled a few hours before I arrived.

I had to fork out about 300pounds extra just to house my family because I didn't have the time to search around and get something cost effective.

Airbnb were completely unresponsive on the day.  Didn't help at all.  Didn't censure the host for doing this to us.  Didn't compensate us at all for the money we lost in the process.  To add to their awful performance they removed the review I put on the cancellation, where I simply stated that they cancelled hours before we were to access the property.

I will NEVER use Airbnb again.  Never.  Avoid like the plague."
2024-11-19,1,Deposit taken before booking confirmed,I made a booking for a few days away at Easter which went to the host for confirmation. The host came back and said that the sale of the property had just come through before they had a chance to update on the site. Airbnb still took my deposit and said it would be refunded and could take up to seven days. I don't get how they can take the deposit before the booking is confirmed!! I would like to book somewhere else but can't afford it to until I get my deposit back. First time using Airbnb and won't be using them again.
2024-11-18,1,I really wish there is a zero star as…,I really wish there is a zero star as they do not deserve a 1 star. Please avoid these company if you can. They are a rogue company and just after your money. Terrible customer service who do not care about the host or guest even if you have worked hard to be a superhost. They are very biased and listen to who they want to listen to even if there is clear evidence of the other party lying. They charge so much for cancellation fees and take all your profit and bully and technically force you to settle for less more like a trap. Please avoid these company.
2024-11-18,1,You can't trust the hosts,"You can't trust the hosts. First host cancelled our booking as they were not renting for 2025, second cancelled as they said the prices shouldn't have been released yet, for the third I messaged them to see if they would accept my booking, they confirmed all was OK, but months later they have just contacted me to tell me they won't be supplying the apartment I booked due to a pricing error. Don't trust AIRBNB host reviews on their website as they won't take reviews for problems like this."
2024-11-18,1,DON'T use Airbnb!!!,"They'll take almost half of your income and provide almost no support. I'm so sick of this company. Every time we have an issue with a guest it's a huge battle to have them do the right thing. They will side with guests who are clearly in the wrong even when everything is documented. They will tell you ""it's our policy"" then won't provide any link to said policy. All of their support has thick foreign accents creating a very difficult language barrier yet they prefer to talk on the phone. When they do text in the app they'll close the support ticket before you even get a chance to respond.
We'll be taking our listings elsewhere!"

2024-11-16,1,I join the chorus about the lousy…,"I join the chorus about the lousy customer service Airbnb exhibits. My girlfriend and I rented a room in Burlington, close to Toronto. We had a nice stay who only wanted the best for us. We booked the room for 14 days, but when we got to the house on the third and last day, there had been a murder in the backyard and the whole house was cordoned off by the police. We were 9 people who were excluded from the house, including a young mother with two small children. We tried to get in touch with Airbnb, but they were only interested in how much of a refund they could get away with sending back. But we needed rehousing. Our host was there but she couldn't do much. We got no help in this chaotic situation. The house was closed for 48 hours. We were allowed to collect personal medicine, otherwise the house was completely closed. We finally booked a hotel room, which was not easy at 11pm, and expected Airbnb to refund this, but they have kept us to this extent, repeatedly closed our case, talked to employees who knew nothing and spoke almost incomprehensible English, they had to have our story over and over and finally ignored every message from us. They completely do not care about their customers/guests. So we also want to warn against using this irresponsible company. It is possible that it is a cheap form of accommodation, but if something out of the ordinary happens, there is no help from Airbnb.
Jeg melder mig til koret om den elendige kundeservice Airbnb udviser. Min kæreste og jeg lejede et værelse i Burlington, tæt på Toronto. Vi havde en flink været der kun ville os det bedste. Vi bookede værelset i 14 dag, men da vi kom til huset den tredjesidste dag, var der forgået et mord i baghave og hele huset var afspærret af politi. Vi var 9 personer der var udelukket fra huset, heraf en ung mor med to små børn. Vi forsøgte at komme i kontakt med Airbnb, men de var kun interesseret i hvor stor en refusion de kunne slippe af med at sende retur. Men vi havde brug for genhusning. Vores husvært var der men hun kunne ikke gøre så meget. Vi fik ingen hjælp i denne kaotiske situation. Huset var lukket i 48 timer. Vi fik lov til at hente personlig medicin ellers var huset totalt lukket. Vi bookede tilsidst et hotelværelse, hvilket ikke var let kl 23, og forventede at Airbnb ville refundere dette, men de har i den grad holdt os hen, gentagende gange lukket vores sag, talte med medarbejdere der intet vidste og talte et næsten uforståeligt engelsk, de skulle have vores historie om og om igen og sidst ignoreret enhver besked fra os. De er fuldstændig ligeglade med deres kunder/gæster. Så vi vil også advare imod at bruge dette uansvarlige firma. Det er muligt det er en billig form for overnatning, men sker der noget udover det almindelige, er der ingen hjælp at hente hos Airbnb.

First night we arrived we have an ant infestation on the bed. Contacted airbnb support sent pics and videos. Was told not to worry as they are there to help. I also contacted the host which has tried his best to fix issue but it hasn't happened due to our of his hand control. Now we are on day three with messaging back and forth to the support and host. Support has not helped us with finding a new place, expects us to pay for new place, or coupon of 20% of what we payed upfront. I asked what there policy is for AirCover which I read but they will not give me a answer. We are currently sitting here in limbo , water has been cut off to unit. Told we need to be out of unit by 3pm today with no place to go refund takes 15 days which don't help. This stay with airbnb has been the worse possible stay imagined. We have another 7 days and both myself and my wife want to cancel this stay and go home it's that bad. If it wasn't for our daughter getting married we would have changed flights and left already. Horrible experience with them. I will never book through airbnb again no matter where I travel to. DO NOT EXPECT HELP FROM THEM IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHILE ON VACATION. "

So for years I’ve used Airbnb happily and felt confident in them. I’ve always understood the cleaning fee is additional. What I don’t like is doing a search for 2 people booking a place based on two people going to then pay for it then to have the owner tell me it’s an additional £28 as there are two of us not helpful when you are on a budget and wasted my time. I had to request a cancellation the owner was fine with it but I’m still now waiting for most of my money back apparently it can take 14 days. Our trip was last month and I had to pay for alternative accommodation so I’m nearly £100 out of pocket so it’s effecting my budgeting atm. I’ve had to chase up Airbnb who promise it’s been processed then call my bank that’s been another hour of my time wasted and I have to wait until Friday. 
Be aware is all I say I’ve never encountered this additional person fee and if I request accommodation for 2 people I expect Airbnbs system to base my options and costings on that. Now had to go elsewhere it’s a real pity. "

Airbnb have now removed the review as they say it violates their policy as it was written in retaliation. Isn’t that what a review is? You documenting your experience of something? What an absolute joke as now I can’t trust Airbnb. No wonder this host had such fantastic reviews and no negative ones, as all the negative ones she has removed. I would be very careful using Airbnb and reading the reviews as they aren’t an accurate reflection of peoples experiences. "

Multiple times I have been given a full refund for an atrocious experience by the host before contacting Airbnb about it, and what am I going to do, leave a bad review after a full refund? For both these reasons, The system is rigged that you feel pressure to leave good reviews or none at all. I’ve had incredibly filthy places, places that are pitch pitch black dark in a remote country spot with no lights left on (I mean black), the only toilet broken and told “just try not to use it”, heavily soiled sheets and towels, dirtiest microwave ever, owner didn’t leave heat on in winter so you arrive and thermostat set to 5 degrees, owner warning me there was a bear near my door today, wifi not working, attacked by owners dog, shower broken on arrival and takes three days to work, owner didn’t pay utility bill so arrive with no electricity, owner cancelled last minute, mold three times, non existent landlords, I can go on… "
2024-11-12,1,Terrible Customer Service.,"I am not surprised to see that Airbnb has such a low rating.

I own 50% of a house that is being rented illegally. I contacted Airbnb and sent them full details. I also included a letter from my lawyer verifying the situation. Everything was laid out, but the operator didn't understand or, more likely, didn't read the email and said they ""couldn't help with my enquiry"". They didn't respond to my reply.

After messaging him that its misleading , he replied that it will not get any better place in this price in Dubai . 
I raised this with Air bnb straight away they sent me an email saying your refund of £1925 will be refunded keeping £950 for service . 
What Bloody Service !! 
This is total scam and this site needs to be reported and closed down . Theft !! "

We used another company and had 5 amazing days then went Airbnb on the last two days and it was a nightmare   

The place was old and moldy with broken furniture and caravans literally on our front doorstep but worse of all the decking was lethal, literally like an ice rink when it was wet. My partner fell really badly and dropped all our luggage and I couldn't walk on it at all so ended up staying in the whole weekend as I have bone issues and was terrified to fall and get a major injury.

2024-11-09,1,blocked account by no reason and no access to support,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with Airbnb. I rented an apartment that turned out to be situated above a shop that generated a lot of noise every morning and night due to the opening and closing of protective covers over the windows and doors. This noise made it impossible to rest properly.

I contacted the owner to discuss the issue, but they were unhelpful and claimed to be unaware of the problem, which seemed disingenuous given the circumstances. Due to the ongoing disturbance, I decided to cancel my stay and paid the required cancellation fee.

However, things took a turn for the worse when Airbnb unexpectedly blocked my account without any explanation. They canceled my new booking and did not refund my money. Attempts to reach out to customer support were met with promises of a callback that never happened. After several emails, they informed me that my account was removed and my funds would be returned, but I have yet to see any refund. My appeal has been ignored.

This experience has been incredibly frustrating, and I feel let down by both the host and Airbnb's customer service. I hope this review helps others be cautious when booking through Airbnb."
2024-11-08,1,Scammed and no help. ,We got scammed as the accommodation we was going to stay in was none existent and Air b&bs customer service team was shocking. They didnt even bother getting intouch with the headquarters of the appartments where we was staying so they could inform them on this scam. The host refused to refund us which he was going too as he was a scammer and Air B&B just accepted that. The host has 6 high end appartments on air b&b so more people are goinf to get scammed by this person in the future and air b&b will allow it. Can i just add that it cost £1500. We was stuck in London with no accommodation and had to find last minute. It completely stressed us all out and wrecked the trip. We had to stay in an area miles away from where was wanted to be. 
2024-11-08,3,"5 stars, really!","Last home we stayed in has beautiful, comfortable furniture but unfortunately infested with Asian beetles! Communication with these people? We had to call them 1/2 hour before arrival to get entry info. During this call the lady tells us she was at the home 8 hours earlier vacuuming up the beetles and that there might be a few bugs there when we get there, a few bugs my rear end!! Lady, why didn’t you call us at that point?
The stay before that we get a messsge 2 days before we leave on a 1250 mile  trip we might see some pine beetles which in reality were cockroaches, and we might need to change our plans, are you kidding me?! Funny thing was, the people that stayed before us had a wonderful experience, the place was clean and comfortable and just everything you would want to hear! I don’t get it.
We’ve been staying in air BnB 12 plus years but we are so done with them!
Oh by the way, you gotta love the hosts that have their dog in their family icon picture and then tell you “ no pets allowed “, that makes me feel welcome, NOT!

Airbnb are supporting this extortion by demanding  this money from me.  We did not break the fridge and they have no evidence that we did ( because we didn’t!) When I have tried to call them to make sure they are not going to charge me tomorow I cannot get through.

I advised I wasn’t happy with $50 and wanted a full refund of £131, they contacted myself and when they couldn’t answer the questions being asked stated I was being rude and threatened to put the phone down. They also accidentally advised that nothing had been raised with the host! Even though I had send proof of the rodents 2 days before the phone call.  I advised this was poor because the way the host has acted suggested he didn’t care and had most likely allowed people to stay for the last 2 nights since I had reported it. 

Customer service was very unhelpful and don’t seem to care people are renting out flats with mice infestations! "

The disgusting violent hosts need to be locked up in jail and have their poor kids taken away that they force to live in their filthy houses. One Italian male Host almost hit me in my face. Airbnb then, instead of helping me, kicked me out of their platform! The female British host with two young children was clearly not ok in the head. She had random guys hanging around the house, the house was full of ants and she cancelled my reservation while I was in the house! Airbnb protects these hosts because they are all the same shit in their filthy minds.

This happened to my daughters in Indianapolis. Airbnb terms of service states they will assist with alternate accommodation. They offered a refund in the form of a coupon for the next trip. Who would be stupid enough to use them again ? I told them to give the coupon to the person next to them because where it needs to go it should be shoulder depth at the least . I’m going to get busy on creating a site to review businesses that can get 1-5 star reviews and s**t stains like Airbnb can get multiple negative stars to reflect the actual rating they deserve.

I had already paid out of pocket for an ER visit plus medications, and had missed a lot of work.  AirBnB support decided to only refund the unspent nights and disregarded my other expenses.

Had no response at all from the host. Contacted Airbnb customer service who after contacting the host advised that they could not help and if I wanted to book the place would need to pay the full price again meaning it would cost me another 350 on top of the 200 he already kept!!! Think it's legalised extortion. Airbnb took the side of the host. Have used the platform a number of times but will never use again

AIRBNB complied with my request to cancel their reservation. However, they charged me a $200.00 cancellation fee and removed me as a Super Host. I called customer service (AGAIN) to complain about the cancellation fee. Now AIRBNB has blocked my calendar altogether. We have stopped getting bookings for this unit since I asked them to cancel the unauthorized reservation. Also, every time I unblock the calendar, it automatically blocks entire calendar for 2024 -2025 and beyond.

No, I left a bad review because the place was a sh*thole and the stay was horrific! I had ZERO correspondence with the host about my review nor did I ever threaten the host. I asked Airbnb for evidence if they are going to accuse me of something and nothing but crickets. There are other options.

They go to the ends of the world to prevent you from communicating directly with the customer. They intimidate you by treatening to withold YOUR money if you dont send them a photocopy of your passport. They take days to resolve software/ synchronisation issues with your Channel Manager-Eviivo, in our case. They always say its Eviivo's fault, whether it is or not, and some don""t even offer the most basic advice.
Most don't offer to help, and dont phone back when they say they will. 
This week, they sent 2 groups of guests to the same chalet and their messaging software had de-synched from ours. Told us it was our fault. Eviivo got them to fix things amd sent us a link.
Now  their software has shown both chalets unavailable till 22 Nov but 1is vacant. Been waitin 3 days for them to fix that. Ongoing.......
We are on many website but our advice to anyone just wanting just1 Online Travel Agent is to avoid Airbnb like the plague, they will have you tearing your hair out with fristration! Booking.com have a much better system- it works properly and they will actually help you if you need it.

2024-11-01,3,AIR BNB IN New Orleans 170 St Thomas St ,"Not a ding for the actual Airbnb app, but a ding for the treatment by the owner after the stay. We stayed in a beautiful home in NOLA for a week. No issues with the home itself, but after leaving the home, (we stayed at a hotel for 2 days after while still in town), I inadvertantly left behind property  in a bedroom drawer (Samsung Pixel earpods, portable cellphone charger, RayBan prescription eyeglasses, RayBan sunglasses). Owner would not let us return to the home to collect items becuase it was already occupied? They first said they did not find any proeprty, and then claimed they only found the eyeglasses which I had to describe, and said it would  cost $100 to mail them back to me in California. I understand it was my mistake for leaving property behind, but there is no way the home was occupied 2 hours after we left. I have a relative who said she would go pick up the items for me and at first the owner said yes, then a couple of days later (they would not respond to text messages or phone calls) said no because it was a security risk and they could only mail them to me. I know they took the missing items and It will cost me hundreds of dollars to replace everything but lesson learned, keep everything in my suitcase from now on!! So angry!"

We paid for 5 nights - about $800.  I have a bad back and ask the owner/host specific questions about the mattress BEFORE BOOKING and he lied.  Just as bad, AIRBNB did not help at all.  All we ask for was a partial refund.   They completely sided with the HOST even though he lied and admitted to unsanitary conditions.   People please be aware that AIRBNB will likely side with the HOST, since they get a percentage of the rental fee.  Also, help others and complain.

Somehow I am rated a Super Host but this is nonsense AirBnB treat me awful. First of all every time someone stays they charge both guests and myself separate admin fees.

However what's really upset me is sometimes bookings are automated and sometimes I have to approve. Seems random. Anyway today a booking automated and within an hour I tried to cancel as I was double booked and AirBnB actually charged me 50% of what was paid by the guest as a punishment for the cancellation. This is petty dictatorship type behaviour. 

I have asked to have my Super Host status removed as I don't want to be associated with AirBnB anymore and I'll cancel my account once all bookings complete.

Honestly, if you are a host, don't bother."

We used only the toilet paper provided, flushing nothing else, and disposed of other items, like makeup wipes, properly in the trash. The pump was functioning without issue during our stay, and the photo we were sent afterward clearly showed signs of pre-existing damage.

Despite this, the host is demanding $480 for a repair we did not cause. The situation has left us feeling not only unfairly accused but also as though we were racially profiled. As respectful guests who take care to treat every property with respect, this experience was extremely disappointing and upsetting. We would not recommend this property to anyone who expects to be treated fairly and without bias. This took place at 647 New London Rd, Newark,DE! "

Now, the host is demanding $480 for a repair we did not cause, attempting to hold us responsible for what appears to be pre-existing damage.

No help whatsoever, pathetic compensation and I'm now out of pocket for an inadequate property they happily continue to display on their platform. 

Interestingly, any negative reviews can be avoided by hosts as they will simply refuse to write one for those staying, meaning that when they know people will not be rightly complimentary about a property, they can just do nothing.

I tell him that I can’t cancel because I won’t get refunded but that he should cancel on his end. He refused to cancel because he wants me to so that he can pocket the money and then open the reservations again to be paid double.

2024-10-23,1,Account Restricted Due to Poor App Functionality,"I had a frustrating experience with Airbnb that led to my account being restricted because of issues with guest capacity and payment processing. I tried to book a stay, carefully adding both overnight guests and visitors within the maximum limit the app allowed. However, the app didn’t provide any warning or indication that including visitors might cause a problem. I assumed everything was fine since the booking system accepted my input.

Things got worse when my payment was declined without a clear explanation, and shortly after, my account was restricted without notice. It felt unfair since the app’s lack of clarity misled me into thinking my booking was in compliance. The absence of helpful error messages or warnings made it impossible to address the issue before Airbnb took action.

Airbnb really needs to improve its guest management system and provide better real-time notifications for errors. Users should be warned about potential violations upfront, and payment errors should be explained clearly. Until they fix these issues, I can’t recommend the app—it’s too easy for small misunderstandings to lead to big headaches."
2024-10-23,1,Horrific experience,"Horrific experience, will never use Airbnb ever again!!

This has to be the most insulting company on the planet to customers who pay hard earned money to be ripped off and have their special times ruined. 

We booked a private home to spend our wedding eve and day and night in, with our immediate families. The home looked fabulous on the advert, It was failed to mention it was a functioning bed & breakfast, with cameras inside the dining room and the owners living behind adjoining doors marked 'private'. my phone number was given to numerous people without my consent who contacted me. our conversations were overheard and even to the point I was contacted regarding an issue we had not even discussed with the 'host' 'owner'. 

Airbnb are so obstructive, they want the customer to prove the faults via photo when in reality all we wanted to do with our families was get out of there. I will never ever use this 'organization' again. it is a scheme set up to rip people off and not take accountability, for the lack of information in hosts adverts and transparency in the rules of the home, which the hosts can change at the drop of the hat. 

Customer first I think not"

The directions are terrible. I tried to do everything they said to do. They sent me a message that said it would take up to 10 days to approve my application. Then, the next day, they rented my home in February without even consulting me at a price half of what I get for in-season rentals. I have already rented for almost twice the price they set for that period. The price was set for off-season rental rates. If that was not bad enough when I contacted them they blamed me for not knowing how their terrible programs work. No customer care. They wanted to charge me $50 plus 10% of the rent.  Sorry, I am not going to let a big corporation push me around.  If you do business with them be careful all they want to do is use your property like a prostitute. They do not care about the owner of the property. When I talked with them they blamed it on third party. (someone in the bask office said bla bla)"
2024-10-23,1,Airbnb Facilitated a Scam: A Cautionary Tale,"
I recently fell victim to a scam facilitated by Airbnb. After booking a month-long apartment in Nottingham, I arrived to find a filthy, dilapidated space that bore no resemblance to the advertised photos. When I contacted Airbnb's customer service, they were dismissive and insisted I reach out to the landlord directly.
The landlord promised to send someone to clean and contact me with an update, but I never heard from him again. Upon returning to the apartment, I found it still to be in a disgusting state, with the bathroom being particularly appalling.
I reported the issue to Airbnb multiple times, but their response was always the same: they would 'look into it' and get back to me. Frustrated and out of options, I was forced to book a hotel room. Despite providing video evidence that the apartment was not as advertised, Airbnb refused to issue a refund.
This experience has made me wary of using Airbnb in the future. It's clear that the platform is not doing enough to protect its users from unscrupulous landlords.

Then they didn't allow me to make smaller bookings with this credit. If i use it for a booking worth less money than the credit then i lose the credit. This is insanse.

2024-10-21,1,No heating in a house during a period where it fell to freezing temps. Airbnb did not care. No refund. ,"Airbnb does not care about vacation home renters. I booked a house that apparently had no heating, it was hidden under “Amenities” and not clearly stated in the description which talked about everything including No Pets Allowed but could not dedicate space to not having heat. It was going to drop to freezing during my stay and that was just not an option. People die from hypothermia. When I tried to cancel, the management wouldn’t return me a full refund. Airbnb subsequently refused to help either. 

Heat and the survival of its customers is clearly not a basic requirement. Before you book anything through Airbnb make sure you ask the right questions, is there heat, running water, potable water, flush toilets, no pests, etc. because don’t take it for granted. It could be tucked away under a pulldown tab somewhere. "

2024-10-20,5,Super supportive when it was really needed,"We booked a villa in Corfu at fairly short notice via the air bnb website (2 days before). The villa was supplied via Hestia travel Corfu, on it’s list of amenities was flat screen TV and free internet throughout. 
We arrived at a cute little villa with a pool, albeit rather remote in the hills.  
Unfortunately, this is when the issue became apparent - there was no usable Internet with initially download & upload speeds of only 0.75 MB/s and 0 MB/s respectively measured at the router using the accepted Ookla international standard.  This only ‘increased’ to 1.3 MB/s and zero, respectively on rebooting.  This was too slow to support the advertised Smart TV streaming Netflix and impossible to send even basic messages!  We had to drive to a Taverna to borrow a phone to message the ‘host’ Georgios of Hestia Travel Corfu.
In fairness, he arrived promptly BUT was passive aggressive from the outset stating “the property has WiFi but just not fast WiFi” - but look at these speeds!  He didn’t call the ISP for advice or arrange an engineer (but in truth really needed to spend some money on a decent data package).  Rather, he pretended to accept the cancellation and agree a refund as we had to find alternative accom and then barely an hour later, denied  it despite the evidence.  Airbnb were brilliant and managed the full refund (of which to date Hestia Travel has only offered two nights refund despite Airbnb upholding our complaint based on the attached evidence rather than the host’s unfounded comment since he had zero evidence).  Throughout Airbnb communicated and advised us and really listened. My husband and I were very impressed with the service.

2024-10-19,1,"When things go wrong, you're essentially on your own","Airbnb's high booking fees are a bitter pill to swallow, especially when their support system proves unhelpful. Our recent stay turned into a nightmare when the apartment we rented lost power for two entire days. Despite our immediate appeal to Airbnb, their response was more platitude than problem-solving.

We were left in the dark, literally and figuratively, without basic amenities like Wi-Fi, heat, or refrigeration. The experience was nothing short of a disaster. To add insult to injury, Airbnb refused our request for a partial refund, even for just one of the days without electricity. Their lack of empathy and support is a stark reminder that when things go wrong, you're essentially on your own.

If you're considering Airbnb, be prepared for the possibility of encountering issues and receiving little to no assistance."

My host by the way- not so great. I wound up cancelling due to work date changes and cancelation policy was refund 50%. They just decided that the portion I had paid was the 50% unpaid. That being said- this is not the first time. Airbnb hosts will burn you and rip you off ANY TIME they have the opportunity.

2024-10-17,1,As a Superhost,"As a Superhost, I expect a certain level of professionalism and competence from Airbnb support, which has been severely lacking in my experience. I am writing to express my complete dissatisfaction with how Airbnb handled issues, displaying a clear inability to listen to and respect Superhosts that work in an honest, clear and respectful way. 

The support provided a completely opposite decision one day after another, creating a much more confusing and conflictual situation and becoming totally unreliable for what concerning decision-making analysis of the situation. 

Throughout the process, I have received conflicting and unreliable information from various Airbnb representatives. Messages are often contradictory, and the support team seems more interested in providing surface-level responses than actually resolving the problem at hand. This creates unnecessary confusion, frustration, and an overall impression of incompetence.

This treatment is unacceptable, particularly given the status as a Superhost who has contributed significantly to your platform.

I am extremely disappointed with the lack of clear communication, the contradictory messages, and the overall disregard for the urgency of the situation. Airbnb’s support for Superhosts should reflect the value we bring to the platform, but this experience has shown otherwise."

I booked a place after confirming with the host there was an elevator however only when we actually arrived at the apartment building were we told the elevator doesn't work and the apartment is on the 6th floor. Passing residents told us this has been broken for months and that it won't be fixed for a few more weeks. So not wanting to lug the stroller and bags up and down 6 flights of stairs every time we come and go we had to cancel the booking. Contacted the Airbnb who said they would contact the host and then get back to me. Given it was late at night (9pm) you'd think they'd call back soon, especially with a crying baby in the background. I call them back 30m later and am told that they will help with a refund only and I need to do another booking. Now booking last minute hotel late at night ended up costing us more than double than if we'd booked the hotel in the first place and Airbnb never got back to me again. So I was left late at night with a cryinging baby and no place to stay, made to pay more than double for a hotel. I don't think I'll ever use Airbnb again as this was a very stressful evening with no help from Airbnb"

2024-10-14,1,TitleExtremely Disappointing Experience – Scammed Twice!,"Title: Extremely Disappointing Experience – Scammed Twice!

I’ve had a truly dreadful experience with Airbnb while trying to book accommodation for the Valencia Marathon weekend (Nov 28 - Dec 2). This nightmare has been going on since July, and it’s left us in an incredibly stressful situation.

First, we booked an apartment, only for the host to ask us to cancel due to “building works” and push for the cancellation to be made on our end. Luckily, Airbnb stepped in and forced them to cancel, which should’ve raised alarm bells about the host. But thinking it was an isolated issue, we booked another property—only to have the exact same scam happen again. This time, it turned out to be the first host’s mate running the same scheme, and again, they tried to get us to cancel.

We’ve been completely messed around on one of the busiest weekends in Valencia, and now we’re left with nowhere to stay. All affordable options are gone, and we’ve been pushed way over our budget. The fact that Airbnb allows hosts like these to operate is shocking, and customer support has not been helpful enough in fixing the situation.

Airbnb, this is a coordinated scam, and you should be doing far more to protect your customers. We expect you to find us suitable accommodation at the price we initially paid and block these fraudulent hosts immediately. This whole situation has been a massive waste of time, energy, and money.

Unacceptable. We trusted Airbnb, but this experience has been a disaster from start to finish."
2024-10-14,1,Airbnb is an utter scam,"Airbnb is an utter scam. I booked accommodation for myself & some friends that will be visiting me from abroad, the money got taken from my credit card, but then the host decides to cancel my booking because she’s greedy and wants more money (yep, apparently that’s ok to do - no repercussions for the host). 

So now, not only do I no longer have accommodation, I also can’t use my credit card because Airbnb won’t release the funds for at least 7 days. I’ve tried contacting their customer service department who have fobbed me off and tried to blame my credit card company, and basically said they won’t do a thing about it.

So I can’t book any accommodation or use my credit card until I receive these funds back - and who knows when that will be? My credit card company told me it usually takes Airbnb around 10 days to release the funds.

This is disgraceful - how can they get away with this??? Not only are their fees outrageous, their customer service is in the toilet, and their hosts can apparently act however the hell they want. "

Do not rent through Airbnb unless you want trouble and not support from this platform. You provide a 5* experience for all guests but every now and then you get terrible guests who make up lies and trash the house and then claim refunds. The airbnb team always rule in favour of the guests and you don’t even get a chance to counter or see any “evidence” they provide. It’s outrageous. The worst part is they do not even tell you that deductions will be made or give any communication to this affect so you are essentially financially harmed at a random future date. It’s unacceptable when this income supports hosts lives and we haven’t done a thing wrong but provide excellent accommodation and adhere to standards. There is no wonder people are not hosting here anymore. Avoid.

2024-10-13,1,Disappointed with Airbnb's Lack of…,"Disappointed with Airbnb's Lack of Accountability and Unfair Practices

I am writing this review to express my extreme dissatisfaction with Airbnb and their unethical business practices. As both a host and a guest, I have experienced firsthand how Airbnb unjustly takes money from hosts, fails to protect users, and consistently shifts blame onto others to avoid responsibility.

As a host, I have had funds taken from my payouts without any reasonable explanation or valid reason. Airbnb's customer service was unhelpful and did not provide any meaningful resolution. It is clear that Airbnb prioritizes profit over the well-being of their hosts, showing a blatant disregard for their partners.

Furthermore, as a guest, I have encountered numerous issues with accommodations that were not as advertised or were unsanitary. Despite reporting these issues to Airbnb, they consistently sided with the hosts and refused to take appropriate action to address the problems. This lack of accountability demonstrates Airbnb's failure to protect their users and uphold their responsibilities.

Overall, my experiences with Airbnb have been disappointing and frustrating. It is evident that Airbnb is more concerned with maximizing profits than ensuring a safe and fair platform for both hosts and guests. I urge others to be cautious when using Airbnb and to consider alternative platforms that prioritize integrity and transparency."

Airbnb is a convenient platform, but it could definitely improve. One major issue is the overpriced cleaning fees, which often make what initially seems like an affordable stay much more expensive.

But he lied and a few hours before travelling we had to get even more stress and had to call Airbnb multiple times to help us find a resolution. Airbnb only gave us half of the money which was paid and the rest was stolen by the host. The people from Airbnb said they will fine the host who was a scammer but nothing happened. It's a pity that when there is a problem Airbnb doesn't care about sorting it out.
2024-10-08,1,I feel bad I cannot leave 0 star,"I feel bad I cannot leave 0 star. 
They pretend to be a very strict website with a lot of terms and conditions but none of them protects the hosts. 
They wasted 20 days of mine responding to them and answering every question. 
They started asking the same questions many times. It was an awful experience.
What's mostly important is that they didn't send me my last payout. 
To avoid any other complaints from my side they and to avoid sending me the payment they decided to block my account and deleted it before I started to complain. 
They say I had the right to appeal and to reclaim my account back, but trust me. 
It is not worth spending another week waiting for their response because they will always give you a negative answer.

2024-10-08,1,Bad to non existent support service,"I booked through Airbnb and payment was taken, 10 days later under the same reservation code a further $125.00 was taken, I have sent several messages to Airbnb support to only keep getting the same standard answer, that someone else must have booked on my card, even though I’ve explained to them it’s the same reservation nr and does not show up in my app. It’s been a month now and still no intrest from them in sorting this out. Now when I contact them they close the case before I can even ask them what’s going on. Not impressed at all, I will never leave my card details on my app again! "

2024-10-08,2,Giving up on AirBnb,"I try to stay in Airbnb apartments every week or soon the road, so I can do laundry, and not pay  tourist prices for food every day. Unfortunately, more and more these days with the proliferation of for-profit short term rental  companies that really aren’t personal, I found that these stays are almost always suboptimal. The apartment may be clean enough or have a classic style, but the amount of stuff one has to buy, including often laundry detergent, coffee pods, fresh milk and etc,  ends up costing more than going out.  I end up carrying a grocery bag with salt, olive oil, coffee, pods, laundry, pods, etc., with me, but I still spend more. In addition there’s almost always something wrong with the place; a long flight of stairs or three that were not mentioned in any of the reviews or the description, or a construction project that’s going on in the apartment upstairs. The apartment may overlook a busy bus stop, or bar where people talk and laugh until four in the morning every night, or there may be a trash pick up right outside your bedroom window. 
Lastly, one is often staying out of the center of town; This can be great in terms of getting a sense of parts of a city that aren’t touristy, But if you’re only staying for a few days, it doesn’t make sense to learn the whole metro system.
I also feel like it’s having an impact on housing costs in some of the places that I’ve visited. For all these reasons, I’ve decided to give up on Airbnb apartments for future European and US destination city travel, and stick to hotels. They may be more expensive, but they’re far less hassle."

In fact, one of my recent guests damaged my belongings and stole items from my home. I filed a complaint and provided evidence, including a police report. While I was expecting the guest’s account to be closed, my account was shut down, accusing me of damaging and stealing items from a host's property.
For the past 3 weeks, I have been working hard to reopen my account. I’ve made nearly 200 phone calls and sent around 100 emails to Airbnb support. I also reached out through Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram, but I haven’t received any resolution. The support agents I spoke to said they couldn’t see a reason for my account to be closed, and it’s still under review by the specialized team. However, this team hasn’t contacted me.
Because no one has contacted me from the specialized team, I filed a complaint about them as well, and my case was escalated to upper management with high priority. But I still haven’t received any emails or calls.
I feel abandoned by Airbnb, waiting for the support they promised after my guest stole my belongings and damaged my home. To make matters worse, a support agent who wanted to close the guest’s account ended up closing mine instead. I have been trying to explain this for weeks and get my account reopened."

2024-10-06,1,They don't care about you,"Airbnb support is the worst I have ever experienced. We could not make it to our cabin due to road closures from Hurricane Helene. We tried mutiple routes which were all closed due to roads being washed away and flooding. Our host refused to give us a refund stating that she has a mortgage to pay and she is not responsible for our travel decisions, as if we had a choice. I guess I should have skydived in from airplane to get to my airbnb. I contacted support and they informed me they have the authority to override her decision. I did everything they told me to do, and they declined the refund. So I asked to connect with a supervisor. I have been waiting for a call back for 3 days now. They said 3 hours. I have called back mutiple times and the supervisor has still not called me back. This is trash service. I have been using them for 9 year. After this experience, I won't ever use them again. "

However, when I received the instructions, I was told that the tenant lady wouldn't be there and also I would share the flat with 2 other strangers : including one man. 

Had I known I would share a flat with a man, I would have never booked. I won't be risking sexual harassment, rape, groping. A vast majority of rapists are men, I am not making this up. 
When I raised these concerns, the co hosts insulted me.

Airbnb refused to give me a full refund for a place we were at for a total of 20 minutes and said we need to go get pictures of “blood on the sheets” or “bites from the bed bugs” in order to issue a full refund. They would not allow me to speak to a supervisor and would call at 10pm at night when they knew I wouldn’t answer the phone. I provided multiple pictures and videos of this place and they said there was not enough evidence and lied about not seeing the photos sent in the digital chat where I then had to provide screenshots of our conversation.

2024-10-05,1,Always a NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE with AIRBNB...,"I've used Airbnb a couple times and have only had negative experiences. This last time was the last straw.. I booked a home in Hollywood Florida by Andrew and Maria (I believe they live in NYC). When I arrived the house looked abandoned and nothing like the photos. Standing at the door there was a bad smell, we enter the home and they smell was like something out of a nightmare! You can compare it to a urine/sewer/moldy smell. It was dirty like the place hasn't been used in a very long time. The couches had dirt and red stains on them. It was inhabitable. My mum got a headache upon arrival so we quickly exited the house. And contacted the owners as we sat in our car with nowhere to go. We were in there about 5 minutes or less... 

I say all this to say the owners and AIRBNB are giving us the run around and not refunding our money for the 8 days stay. (Over $1000) They keep saying they are working on it but then they close the chat with no resolution! These owners and AIRBNB are thieves. They buy trashy homes, put no work into it and rent it to people looking for a place to stay. It's predatory and unacceptable and just plain hurtful! I keep calling Airbnb and they keep saying the same thing, that they're escalating but it's all lies. They also keep sending me links that DON'T WORK. Not sure how this SCAM came to be and how it's still working. I'd just like a refund not a run around. I'm NEVER using them again and I'm telling my experience to everyone so they don't get trapped like us. "

My worry was how had the dishes been cleaned before// Air B&B said go purchase them and we will reimburse you-great news for a tired traveller.

I was able to eventually get a fair compensation for what I had to go through. But it took a lot of explaining and repetition. I am glad Airbnb did the right thing at the end.

Original Review:

Their ratings are absolutely justified. They are a horrible company. They just wash hands off when their hosts make mistake. For keeping the customer out in the open in the middle of a cold night they offer 50 pound compensation. It clearly shows the how much they value their customer and it very well reflects in their trust pilot rating. I am going to sue you any ways"

 I had no information what happened to my money for the bookings for 20 days , 

as money has been taken for a supposed refund, 
then after 30 days, they're still investigating!
I have been advised to check transaction details as it show nothing, 
I have also been told I got paid for my other guests, but there is no mention of a refund for 20 days and my bank has been investigating. 


the worst thing is they even paid more than I paid him back cutting my pay from my other guests.

Of course, there are no apartments left in that price range, so I ask Airbnb ""Aircover"" to pay the difference for a comparable place. No go.  They will not ""cover"" anything.  Just scandalous.

I contacted Airbnb's costumer service and sent a video proof and a picture that this damage was already there at the beginning of our stay. Nothing happened besides a few nice words from Airbnb. Luckily the host dropped the case when I told him that I have liability insurance for cases like that but the insurance company would check the legitimacy of the claim. - Well, the host gave me a bad review in which he claimed that I had damaged the property. Therefore, I contacted Airbnb's customer service again. In short: They called it ""merely an expression of experience"" and told me that no change of the review would be made.
In my opinion: Airbnb doesn't really care if the reviews are truthful. So don't count on the customer service. And a piece of advice: At the check-in take pictures or a video of the whole rental place."

Clearly no consistent training provided across the company.

The host house we stayed at was infested with bedbugs.

We were not advised of the AirBNB policies regarding this. They're meant to pay for you to stay in a hotel (3 nights) and clean your clothes.

Instead they actively pass you around, not advising you accurately in the attempts of making you give up so they don't have to pay for any of the expenses.

We spoke to 5 different representatives and they all kept advising us differently, they closed tickets which still had open issues or directed us to links and forms, which the website would not allow us to complete.

"
2024-10-01,1,Unreasonable cleaning fees,"Airbnb used to be helpful when travelling because it was cheaper than renting an hotel room. But right now, it is as expensive or much more expensive than hotel rooms. Moreover, you need to pay unjustify hundred dollars in cleaning fees when you have to clean yourself the place before the check-out: take out the garbage and recycle bins, put all the dishes in the dishwasher and starts the machine, strip the bed and group dirty linens together, clean the kitchen counter, etc."

The customer service is a completely useless black hole."

2024-09-30,1,Decade long superhost will not recommend Airbnb,"I'm a decade long superhost on Airbnb and now I will never recommend to anyone to list their property on their platform. I had a guest who damaged our property, violated our posted rules and the guest only partially paid for the cost to repair their damages. When I filed a reimbursement case for the remaining costs the guest did not cover and submitted all documentation showing the costs and damage, Airbnb decided they would only cover about 10% of it. Then when I asked questions as to how Airbnb reviews cases and where I can find their damage reimbursement review policies online, they retracted the 10% of additional coverage they initially offered and then closed my case. They were neither transparent nor supportive to a superhost who has brought them thousands of dollars over the last 10+ years. When I left an honest review of the guest so other hosts could be aware of the damages the guest caused, the guest complained to Airbnb and had the review removed with Airbnb stating I violated their policies of retaliatory reviews. I don't see how an honest review of a guest causing damages to a host property is retaliatory, but perhaps since I mentioned they refused to pay for the full cost of their damages, that is what Airbnb is saying is retaliatory? If you are thinking about hosting on Airbnb, heed my advice and consider something else. Even as a superhost, your status will not matter when you most need it to and their host reimbursement and insurance policy is a scam. Airbnb will not support you and you will be left with a damages bill out of your pocket since requesting deposits are not allowed and Airbnb will be of no help."
2024-09-30,1,Never again with Airbnb,"What a terrible experience compared to VRBO. We have rented dozens upon dozens of homes through VRBO and they have all been positive, properties as described. This is not the case with Airbnb. Used Airbnb once to rent an apartment that was described as having a fenced yard. What the host didn’t say is that fenced yard is shared with children and other people, which was a problem. The host also spied on us the entire time, sending text messages about where we are and what we’re doing and “haven’t seen you at all today.” It was creepy and Airbnb not only denied us the opportunity to leave a review, they offered nothing in the way of an apology."

I did not complete a review since the home was nice and I did not want to commenting on the hosts overbearing personality that could hurt her future business.  I will stick with Vrbo moving forward.
2024-09-29,1,Being charged without my consent ,"media 

A warning about Airbnb 

I recently went to Mijas and rented a property through Airbnb which I have dealt with for 17 separate rentals most for circa £5k so they have had a lot of commission from me. I have always attracted 5 star reviews from the host as I am respectful for others properties. 
This time however I am appalled… I’m cross I never photographed the broken chair in the hedge, the broken parasol just left on the lawn. One of the bedroom doors looked as if someone had punched a hole in it! 
The bedroom we stayed in had the shutters on the windows you let down with a pulley system, anyway one didn’t work so we couldn’t black out the bedroom to sleep. I didn’t make a fuss what a BIG mistake. 
When I got home Airbnb sent me a claim from the alleged superhost for the broken shutter. She sent a photo of it on the floor! I swear that didn’t happen while we were there as I left it because it was stuck. 
I appealed but they are upholding her claim for £150 plus… I complained as they are implying I am a liar even although my history with them is impeccable. 

It’s ruined that holiday, I won’t book with them now as you will need to be on your guard and take photos and report everything. NOBODY wants that on holiday 

Please share as when they said they are taking monies from my credit card clearly without my consent I want everyone to know!

I received no support and Airbnb would not address the fact that my husband and I were blatantly slandered. They would not remove her review of us.  I will NEVER use this company again. We have one more trip already partially payed for through them. After this, account will be closed. Be warned, hosts are not fully vetted and if you are screwed over, you will NOT get help.

2024-09-27,1,Extremely Disappointing Experience with Airbnb and Host Negligence,"I recently stayed at an Airbnb that was advertised as a relaxing vacation home with a pool, but my experience turned into a series of unsafe conditions, lack of maintenance, and complete disregard from both the host and Airbnb.

First, the lawn was wildly overgrown, despite multiple assurances from the host that it would be cut. It never was. The grass was so tall that we even spotted a snake in the yard. When the ""gardener"" finally arrived, he entered the backyard without warning, cursed at my mother, had a child with him (completely unprofessional), and then stole the lawn mower on the property. The host blatantly lied about this, claiming the gardener never spoke to us and that we were the ones making him uncomfortable—ridiculous, considering the man cursed at us in front of witnesses!

Now, the most serious issue — the pool, which was advertised as a primary amenity, was unsafe. There was a light fixture with an exposed wire IN the pool that made the pool completely unusable for our family. I can't believe Airbnb didn’t take this more seriously. The host told us the pool was cleaned twice, but it was clear no pool service came, and we had to clean it ourselves. The host then contradicted herself in messages, stating the pool would be cleaned only after we left. Furthermore, the uneven bricks around the pool caused several of us to trip and roll our ankles. These aren’t minor inconveniences—these are safety hazards.

Airbnb’s response to all of this? A pathetic offer of $200 after the host refused to provide any refund beyond $35. Seriously, $200 for a stay that was riddled with safety issues and lies? When I questioned how exposed wiring in a pool wasn't considered a big deal, I was met with the host’s word being taken at face value — apparently, if a host says something is okay, it just is. How is this acceptable?

To make things worse, Airbnb has made every excuse under the sun to avoid addressing these issues properly. They’ve claimed that since the lawn was “outside the listing,” it doesn’t qualify for their AirCover policy, and despite being shown the exposed wire in the pool, they’re brushing it off.

I work full-time and can’t always answer phone calls at Airbnb’s convenience, but the fact that they continue to ignore these very real safety concerns while hiding behind policy is infuriating. The host lied about so many details, and yet Airbnb acts as if that’s acceptable. Is this how they treat paying guests who rely on their platform for safety and quality?

I’m deeply disappointed, not only with the host but with Airbnb itself. This experience has shattered my trust in their ability to uphold the standards they advertise. I would recommend anyone thinking of using Airbnb to be extremely cautious — don’t expect them to stand by you when things go wrong, even when your family's safety is at risk."
2024-09-27,3,Dubious listings,I have used Airbnb regularly for several years and stayed at excellent places at good prices.  However it seems that increasingly there are dubious listings.  A very common one is for a property which is listed as available to not be be available when you try to reserve it.  The host then tries to offer an alternative ‘off-App’. I haven’t gone down this route but the concerns are obvious.  AirBnB needs to sort this
2024-09-27,2,Company on the slide?,"Having used airbnb a number of times (20+) over the previous 8 years my current experience of trying to book accommodation for a 4 week stay in Turkey is becoming a nightmare. 

In short I have now had five separate hosts asking me to cancel. I know their game, i.e. if I cancel they can then resell the room at a higher rate, but after getting wise I just make them cancel the booking to share my hassle.  

There is a fine imposed by airbnb but considering one of these was being advertised the weeks before and after my booked and paid for visit at 10x my price paid they've probably just had it advertised somewhere else and sold to the highest bidder.

airbnb really need to get a grip on this. Clearly with such a low rating on trust pilot (I was surprised just how low) I am not alone in thinking this is company on the slide."
2024-09-26,1,I got removed from Airbnb because my…,I got removed from Airbnb because my frien was smokeing as he has it for he’s aniexty due to loss of dad some was left in rush as I was unwell and had to left for medical it’s was never to sell or supply to anybody as it was he’s own personal use and I got reported and lost my account after appeal and explaining what happened my account still got close I’ve spent thousands of pounds on Airbnb over 2 years and I find there customer service really really bad I cryed my eyes out as I also suffer from aniexty and ptsd Airbnb need to really do better 
2024-09-26,1,Waste of time…,"Installed the app., created an account, identified a suitable place, reserved and paid for a one month visit. Two days later the host (Rhonda, Wellington Close, KT12 1BB) gets in touch to say that she needs to cancel my visit claiming that her daughter suddenly needs a place to stay(!). Not put off I immediately made another reservation in the same area with another host (John, Farrington Acres, KT13 9NH) for the same duration, he initially accepts and then strangely asks me to amend the dates to just one week which I did. Hours later he gets in touch saying that he needs to cancel my visit because “he forgot that his mum is coming to stay” (yeah right ok mate). What an absolute f**king joke. As soon as my refunds are processed I’m closing my account and deleting the app.

Update 27/9: both refunds have now been received  so that’s something I guess. This was the first time I had used Airbnb and it will be the last."
2024-09-26,1,The worst customer service,"Although my language configurations are set up on English, my receipts are generated in Spanish. This has always been the case and I had no problem with that because I didn't need a receipt until now. So I reached out to customer services who firstly suggested I was not telling the truth about my account language preferences and then asked me personal questions regarding why I needed a receipt in English so urgently. I requested then to generate a receipt in English for Thai specific reservation and they didn't solve my problem besides being disrespectful and inefficient. Their final message was that they just couldn't help me. I know this review is not gonna make any difference and they probably will laugh about this but it's crucial that we reflect on how much decision making power these ""collaboration platforms"" hold and how ""democratic and decentralised"" user agency is in these business models. Shocking! "
2024-09-26,1,Not for me,"Accommodation not entirely as described, though reasonable for a short stay.
Pointed out some minor issues with hosts and gave a generally good review, only to later learn we'd been vilified by the hosts!
Didn't expect go on holiday to be subject to character assassination, but Airbnb seems to condone this practice.  
Too many rules and regulations laid down with payment taken well in advance leaving little scope for cancellations.  
Tried once and was okay, but on reflection, not for me."
2024-09-26,1,Disappointed with Airbnb’s Declining Customer Service and Safety Concerns,"I’m deeply disappointed with how much Airbnb’s customer service has deteriorated. It used to be fantastic, but now it feels robotic, with little to no understanding of genuine customer concerns. What’s even more troubling is the increase in scammers on the platform, exploiting customers and leaving them vulnerable. After two separate experiences where I received no meaningful support when raising a concern, I no longer feel safe or valued as a customer. It saddens me to say that I will no longer be using Airbnb, nor can I recommend it to others until serious improvements are made. What is Airbnb doing to protect its customers and restore the level of care it once had?"
2024-09-26,1,Shocking customer service,"Having booked and stayed at a property which was fine we were then asked to provide feedback on leaving. The only criticism we stated was the garden required attention, grass needed cut, weeding and the small decking was a bit wobbly. They came back and said there were safety issues which was totally incorrect. Don’t book with Airbnb. "
2024-09-25,5,Just been on holiday to the USA,"Just been on holiday to the USA, I booked a special Airbnb out in the desert for the last 3 nights. 5pm the night we was meant to go it was cancelled by airbnb. OMG. We got in touch with airbnb and started a conversation with Ryan, we was told there was an incident in the area, but could not tell me what it was so I went on line and found out there was a murder next door to where we was going to stay. So understandable they cancelled it do to safety. Ryan from airbnb offered us 325 dollars a night to stay in an hotel for the 3 nights. I could not believe what I was being offered. Ended up booking the westin in Palm Springs for 3 nights. Airbnb paid in full for the 3 nights on top of the refund from previous booking, when we arrived at the westin they charged us to park the car for 3 days which airbnb payed for as well. I can not recommend this company enough. Having seen the bad reviews I am amazed. I have nothing but praise for airbnb."
2024-09-25,1,What a scam!,"The first time I booked months in advance and they canceled it on me a month before.  Prices soared and would not help me find a comparable accommodation.

Next they let people list condos that don't have availability.  It shows availability and then you have to wait for the owner to respond.  Then the owner responds saying its no longer available.  I was told by 9 different owners their unit was available but it was listed as available.  Horrible system!"
2024-09-25,1,If I could leave minus 5 stars I would,"If I could leave minus 5 stars I would. We have just returned from an horrendous stay in Azerbaijan where the host was the most unapproachable and rude host we have ever come across. This is in addition to the apartment having exposed screws, loose wiring right next to the shower which was life threatening, a fridge full of food that was past its sell by date, utensils and crockery that were full of grime and dirt and a bed that squeaked so loudly it was impossible to have any kind of sleep. It was horrendously bad and so we checked out early and booked into a local hotel.

Since we have returned, the host has told a complete pack of lies about us which we can disprove on every level but luckily we have screenshots and pictures to support us with Airbnb so they will look after us right? WRONG!!!!!!!! Airbnb do not, repeat, do not care less about past guests, current guests or any future guests, they will do everything in their power to protect hosts because that is where their revenue comes from. We have had message after message from them saying that the hosts feedback doesn't violate any policies. In other words a host can tell lie after lie about guests and Airbnb will have their full backing!! We had exemplary 5 star feedback up until now but thanks to this host having a vendetta against us that has now been ruined and the blame lies solely at Airbnb's door for failing to protect guests when it can be proven beyond all unreasonable doubt that the host has told bare faced lies.

Airbnb laughingly kept telling us that they empathise with us, they value us, they are there for us and they care about us but nothing could be further from the truth. They couldn't care less about guests and only care about themselves and their hosts. They may be the original company to set this sort of business up but there are far, far better ones out there who do actually care about their guests and their experiences, which is the complete opposite of Airbnb who have blatant disregard for their guests and couldn't care less about their experience when things go horribly wrong. So if you are reading this and are thinking of using Airbnb then please do yourself a favour and use a far more reputable site as Airbnb do not value guests in any way, shape or form. All they are interested in is protecting their hosts so they can earn more money from them. Airbnb DO NOT care about you, Airbnb DO NOT empathise with you, Airbnb DO NOT value guests and Airbnb will NEVER be there for you if you endure an horrendous experience.

Their customer service has to be the worst I have ever come across and previous posts on here back up our review 100%. Their customer service for guests is non-existent. They incorrectly advised us from the very start telling us not to worry about any review being left because it would be removed if it was proven to be untrue and after that advice that is why we reported the host, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered as we didn't want negative feedback. Lo and behold they then backtracked and allowed the feedback to stay even though we have irrefutable proof that everything the host said was a complete and utter lie.

Airbnd are a crass, loathsome, unsympathetic, uncaring, bigoted organisation who treat their guests like something they have on the bottom of their shoe. Avoid this utter joke of a company like the plague because if you have any issues at all they could not care less and will do everything in their power to support the host, their main revenue stream. DO NOT go anywhere near them because you will definitely be sorry if you have a bad experience!!!!!"
2024-09-24,1,Appalling Customer Service,"Great if everything goes according to the plan
BUT
As a guest and a super host, I have experienced appalling customer service if the accommodation is not as described or when guests damage my property.
Airbnb insist on hiring cheap low-calibre staff in countries where the workers can't afford to travel to Europe.

I was once awarded £35 to get professional carpet cleaners to clean a soiled carpet. This shows how clueless the staff are about the cost of living in London."

2024-09-23,1,Bad Airbnb host and Airbnb service,"We booked 1436 Page Street Apt1436, San Francisco, CA 94117, United States in July 2024 for a two month stay as working from home while in San Francisco.  The host didn’t tell us he has already had full scale renovation, roof construction and builders arranged for the period we booked.

Moved in on August 14th but as from early September it’s been a full scale building site with constant shouting, scaffolding being put up round the full building. No daylight coming into the apartment and having to keep blinds closed all day for privacy.  The noise makes it impossible to work from here as planned. They caused a leak in the apartment and the constant shouting and banging has got our dog stressed to the max.

Contacted the host who denies knowing anything about the planned works even though he had the construction certificate pre authorised and dates booked till mid November already authorised by the planning department in San Francisco, and yet he still took the booking without warning us.

Trying to get Airbnb to mediate and deal with it has been tiring and pointless to the point that we are having to cut short our trip and move out.  AVOID THIS HOST AT ALL COSTS"
2024-09-23,5,We have had the best holiday,"We have had the best holiday, in fact we even extended our trip.  The house is lovely and has a view from every window.  The house was super clean and tidy, my wife is disabled this property was ideal for her.  The house is central to a lot of activities and close  to a lot of beaches.

Thanks Andy we will definitely be back next year.

2024-09-23,1,Disappointing Airbnb Customer Service and Misleading Listings,"I am absolutely disappointed with Airbnb and their customer service. I booked a house where the listing clearly stated that it had five separate bedrooms. It explicitly mentioned that there were five individual rooms (Bedroom 1 to Bedroom 5). In reality, there are only three proper bedrooms, while the other two ""bedrooms"" are just connected to other rooms without any doors or walls. This is nowhere near what the listing promised.

When I contacted customer service, I received unfriendly responses and was told they couldn't do anything. I don't understand how misleading information is allowed to be listed on Airbnb, and that I can’t even cancel my booking — which I made just a day ago! Instead of a full refund, they offered me a measly 70 Euros out of a total of 1,600 Euros.

It’s absolutely outrageous that such false listings are allowed on the platform, and now the customer — myself — has to pay the price for it. Stay away!"
2024-09-23,1,Absolute shambles,"Absolute shambles! Cancelled our stay at our accommodation 3 weeks before we were due to go. We as a group had all ready booked different activities for this stay. They gave us some alternative options that weren’t even for the same dates. We have now got to wait up to 15 business days before our money even comes back through so we cannot book anything else until this returns. Customer service is shocking, no help, no advice, nothing. Will not be using again! "
2024-09-22,2,I will stick with hotels in the future,"Despite being described as airconditioned, there was no aircon in the masterbedroom in the house just a fan and a heater (not helpful in above 30s heat}. The bathroom had a nasty smell and the shower was overflowing. We left earlier despite no refund and no cancellation policy. Airbnb took our review down stating their policy. They are not interested in true reflection of facts so can't be trusted."
2024-09-22,2,I’m very disappointed with Airbnb’s…,"I’m very disappointed with Airbnb’s handling of my review. Despite being confirmed twice by Airbnb that my review complied with their rules, it has been repeatedly removed, likely at the request of the host. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of the platform’s review process.

It feels like Airbnb is protecting hosts at the expense of transparency, and this practice seems to go against consumer rights. Honest feedback, whether positive or negative, should be allowed to stand to help future guests make informed decisions. Unfortunately, this experience has made me question how genuine Airbnb is when it comes to addressing negative experiences.

Worst ever.
Guys just dont book on this site anymore...."
2024-09-21,1,Just stick with hotels. Avoid Airbnb!,"Just stick with hotels. They will never support you in a claim, landlords will always be favoured. You get charged ridiculous cleaning fees whilst also having to leave the place spotless, and then any issues on top of that you can forget any “support” - just template emails until they can charge you even more. Airbnb was a great idea that lost its way. Avoid like the plague. "
2024-09-21,1,Biased and unprofessional ,"I hosted my flat when i went away, airbnb is biased, unprofessional when it comes to dealing with hosts and guests. They disregarded my house rules and didn’t even try to understand or consider my side of story. Avoid "

i then rang old bank and of course it isn't going to process as no bank account and will bounce back to them.

2024-09-20,1,"Air BNB Disaster, very expensive disaster","I will never use them again. We arrived in Tunisia into a dirty, shabby little vacation house in a horrible vacation village. Everything was broken or about to break and it was miles away from anywhere. The owner was unfriendly and unhelpful. There was no reception. I could not reach Air BnB. I eventually got through to Air bnb after we were attacked by a swarm of wasps apparently living on the grotty porch. We had to go eat lunch in a restuarant as we didn't want to stay with the wasps. What a joke. Eventually got through to air bnb with the restaurants wifi etc. Airbnb canceleed our reservation without finding new accomodation so we were homeless. They sent us links to possible places. We examined them and picked one. They they didn't even explain but sent new links. At this stage we're now a few hours later and still at the restuarant. We found one but we had to go back to get our stuff from the dump of an appartment as airbnb had cancelled our reservation. Rushed back, got our stuff but once again couldnt get through to airbnb as no reception in that dump. Went back to the carpark of the expensive restaurant and tried to make new booking. Couldn't get airbnb to do it for us. They simply wouldn't and we had no/poor reception. Eventually we found something and I managed to contact the owner with zero useful help from airbnb. We went to a beach bar to have drinks whilst they cleaned that house. It cost way more money, we couldnt get anything else. Air bnb did not tell us that it was miles away. Eventually we went there to that place which was way too big and way too expensive. It was nice though and the owner was great. I dont hold him at all accountable but I do hold airbnb accountable. I have complained and complained, they refused to escalate my claim so now all I can do is take legal action. They do not care about you, your children, your safety. They are money making schemers and have no respect for their clients. Don't work for them, dont use them and don't rent your property via them. Home to Go are much, much better. Booking are dreadful as well. Try Kindred. I'll be doing that from now on. No more air bnb or booking for me. Unreliable, charlatons. Shocking! Imagine, we booked way on time and were sent to a dump that airbnb hadn't even checked (the girl on the phone actually told me), then they cancelled our dump reservation, sent us somewhere super expensive and very far away and refused to pay the difference, didn't even compensate us for having to eat and drink elsewhere. Ridiculous. I can't be bothered wasting my time and money sueing them which is what they bank on. I hope and pray you don't use air bnb."
2024-09-20,1,Terrible experience with Airbnb,"Terrible experience with Airbnb, we had 2 bookings on one property, one for Christmas, the other for a week's holiday in York. They were both cancelled a week before we were due to go for the week. Due to having things booked I had to very quickly find an alternative property which cost a further £300 due to lack of availability for dog friendly properties. I am still awaiting both refunds, this is now 3 weeks later! Terrible service, I will never use the company again they cannot be trusted. The host terms and conditions should be amended that a minimum of 1 months should be provided if the property is cancelled by the host to allow enough time for the client to find a suitable alternative."

2024-09-18,2,Can Airbnb get its house in order in supporting hosts?,"This is a review about Airbnb from the host's perspective. Initially, I liked the idea of being able to offer a top service (mostly five stars) whilst earning some extra income. I took my duty of care very seriously towards my guests.

However, increasingly, I have begun to find Airbnb unresponsive and not supportive enough at crucial times. As well as great hosting experiences, have had some horrendous times with guests, inclusive of flooding the place, burning a matress, leaving a stove lit (in absence) doors left open etc, etc. After a hostile, confrontational encounter with a guest (ten months ago), who booked  a single room, wanted to move a woman in, I have not hosted despite only having my savings to live on. 
Airbnb ""SECURITY"" alert system didn't work. Nor was there any follow-up, support, concern or checking in as to how the experience left me. I now almost have a phobia about hosting again. 

Added to that is the lack of contact with respect to getting Airbnb to reflect. Added to that is what I perceive to be a thinly-veiled authoritarianism with respect to whether a host can turn down a potential guest. I feel strongly that there is a hidden weighting behind the guest because they are the cash potential. They can burn your house down but they will be able to locate elsewhere, after all, whereas to lose the cash potential is more problematic. I need to know Airbnb have my back which will be to the benefit of all.  "
2024-09-18,1,Don't use Airbnb,"The rating I want to give is -5. Airbnb are complicit in allowing hosts to advertise on their site who request large deposits after you pay the non refundable rental fee. 
The €800 deposit paid has not been returned by the hosts even though they claim to hold the deposit and refund it a day after check out. 
The large deposit was flagged with Airbnb before payment was made. They said the deposit is guaranteed. It is now 10 days since we checked out from the property and neither Airbnb nor the hosts have returned the deposit."
2024-09-18,1,Horrible service and experience ,"I’m really disappointed with Airbnb. This was only my second time booking through the platform, and I was excited to stay in a nice place in the heart of Rome’s old town. However, my booking was canceled at the last minute due to “concerns about the quality and reliability of the listing.” This cancellation happened just a week before my trip, leaving me with very little time to find alternatives. To make matters worse, there was no proper compensation—just a £20 coupon, which can only be used on bookings over £984.32 and expires in one month. This feels completely inadequate given the inconvenience and stress caused.I will likely avoid using Airbnb in the future and would advise others to be cautious. The service feels unreliable and poorly managed."
2024-09-18,1,"Airbnb Birmingham In house Robbery, they have the Key!","I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding a distressing experience my husband and I had while staying at an Airbnb property. We booked this accommodation for three nights (sunday-wednesday) as a temporary transit, as we would receive the keys to our new home on Wednesday.

The main reason we chose this listing was due to the friendly appearance of the hosts, Helen and Ally, who are presented as two warm, smiling white women on Airbnb. However, upon our arrival on Sunday at 3 PM, we were met not by them but by a man who did not match the hosts’ descriptions. He gave us a tour of the property and handed us a bottle of wine, saying, “I hope you drink it.” We accepted his goodwell.

Later that evening, after moving our last few luggages in around 6 PM, my husband opened the wine. After tasting it, I felt dizzy and went to bed early around 9pm, while my husband only consumed half of the bottle before feeling sleepy himself.

Around 2 AM, I suddenly woke up to find two men in this property—one holding the door and the other rummaging through our belongings. I screamed, and they yelled, “Go, go, go!” before fleeing the scene. My husband chased after them, but they had already disappeared. To our shock, my husband found the key still in the lock—they had forgotten it!

We were terrified and immediately called the police, who helped us change the locks. We discovered that our belongings had been stolen, including an iPhone 14 Plus, headphones, £200 in cash, my engagement pure gold ring, a pure gold bracelet, two debit cards, and five credit cards. Alarmingly, we received notifications that our stolen credit cards had already been used within an hour of the theft.

On Monday afternoon, we informed the host about the incident. However, the same man who initially met us—claiming to be the “site manager”—was the one who came to address our concerns. His response was dismissive: “You can leave if you want, or stay if you want; the police have changed the locks, and the house is now safe.” When I asked to speak with Helen and Ally, he informed me that their information on Airbnb was fake and that the photos were randomly sourced. He claimed the actual host was just one of their employees!

Feeling unsafe and no longer trusting the accommodation, we decided to leave. I contacted Airbnb for assistance around 4 AM after the police left. The initial call went smoothly; I explained that my phone was stolen and that I could not access my Airbnb account or email. I provided my husband’s email and phone number, and the representative assured me they would follow up via email. However, I never received anything.

I made a total of four calls that evening, all of which promised a prompt response that never came. Today, after another attempt, a customer service representative finally sent an email to my husband’s address, but I found out that multiple messages had been sent to my Airbnb inbox from a no-reply address. I am unable to respond because I cannot log in to my account due to the theft.

It is incredibly frustrating that the customer service representatives seem unable to comprehend my situation. To date, no progress has been made, and I am still receiving requests to recount my experience through messages that I cannot reply to. Each time I am forced to relive the trauma, remembering the faces of the intruders, which affects my mental well-being. I now struggle to sleep naturally, relying on medication for rest, and we are currently staying in an expensive hotel for safety.

I urge you to take this matter seriously and provide assistance in resolving this situation. The lack of support we have experienced is unacceptable."
2024-09-18,1,I am a guest in an Airbnb,"I am a guest in an Airbnb. At this time, I won't go into detail about the living experience itself. I am living in a longterm Airbnb and Airbnb deducts payments on the 15th of every month. For some inexplicable reason, on the 15th of September my bank required me to confirm the Airbnb payment before processing it. I confirmed the payment and it was deducted from my account. I even confirmed with Airbnb that they received their payment. The Airbnb app wasn't updated, however... and no one I have spoken to thus far has given me any explanation about why Airbnb keeps trying to deduct payment from my account for the same fee that was already paid. At this point I'm in shock and praying that they don't try to deduct again tomorrow when I have confirmed with them and my bank that the September 15 payment was completed. To make matters even more stressful, one of their representatives messaged me and said they can ""refund the completed payment and charge me again"".  "
2024-09-17,1,"10 years Airbnb, guest no more","I have been an Airbnb guest for nearly 10 years, with fantastic ratings including international stays. I left an honest, positive 4 star review for a recent stay. 30 minutes later, Airbnb called me. They reported that the host, Ted and Ann Marie, sent ""documentation"" that I requested a full refund in exchange for a 5 star review. This property is at 209 Kirkland Ave, Bozeman, BT. I asked to see the documentation, which was denied. I was told it was a text. Of course, I did not send such a thing but my credibility is apparently much less than the hosts. Again, this was a positive review. I gave the stay 4 stars and provided constructive feedback privately to the owner as to what they might consider improving. Long story longer, Airbnb determined that they would remove my rating and review. I objected, as it was honest and professional, completely appropriate. It doesn't take long to see that the host simply wasn't happy with a 4 star review, and was willing to lie to get it removed. This is nuts! I was falsely accused, with zero evidence and a rock solid historical record. Not a thing I could do about it but to delete my Airbnb account and move along to VRBO. GUESTS BEWARE. What a world."
2024-09-17,1,Bed bugs and poor customer service,"Bed bugs! Disappointing Customer Service!

I’ve had an extremely frustrating experience with Airbnb’s customer service. I stayed at a property infested with bed bugs, which was a nightmare in itself, but dealing with Airbnb made it even worse. Despite contacting them right away, it took 3 nights for them to acknowledge the issue and approve my complaint. During that time, I had to endure bites and sleepless nights in an uninhabitable space.

What’s worse is that Airbnb refused to refund me for those nights due to their rigid policy. Apparently, suffering through bed bugs doesn’t qualify for a refund? The whole process was agonizingly slow, and their lack of empathy and accountability was shocking. 

Airbnb's customer service is sluggish and their policies are deeply flawed. I expected more from a company that claims to prioritize its guests. I will definitely think twice before using Airbnb again."

However, unfortunately the quality of the service has significantly declined, to the level where I have recently lost more than 400 euros due to the host's miscommunication and airbnb didn't do anything about it. My disputes got closed without reaching a resolution and it my request on speaking to a more senior Customer Service agent were left open for weeks.

My host had cancelled my booking only hours before check-in. I had found out  on my flight to my destination. Trying to deal with this with urgency, it didn't  seem like I was getting through to any customer service members. Mind you, I was thousands of feet up in the air and couldn't  necesarilly take a call. When I landed, I got in contact with Milly H. who completely saved me by understanding my stress of the situation and managed to book me a place that exceeded my expectations and definitely made up for the incompetence of previous customer service members. She walked me through the whole process and knew how to navigate the issue, providing me with options and clarity. She definitely made my entire day and I hope her and her team sees this so that she gets the recognition she deserves."
2024-09-16,1,"Edmonton, Alberta - Host Nightmare","As a consumer I did my due diligence and contacted the host to confirm the property before I booked.  After booking on March 1/24, I received a confirmation that matched.  Two week s prior to the Aug. 30/24 booking I logged into my AIRBNB account to send the host a message to confirm.  I received a message back verifying all details.  Everything seemed to be in order.
That's when it fell apart.
3 days before checkin, the host calls me to say that there was a ""miscommunication"".  She was not apologetic or remorseful, just simply rude.  Although I had booked a 6 bedroom home, I would only have access to 4 bedrooms.  Apparently the basement suit was rented to someone else.  I explained that I had booked the entire house and was paying the rate of the entire property, not 4 bedrooms.  She then proceeded to say that as a host if she had to move the basement tenants it would cost her money and I would need to pay more.  She said she would check if tenant would move.
The day of checkin arrived and I received instructions and verification that I would have access to the basement.  A key would be in the door that separated the units when I arrived.  Upon checkin, the key was in fact in the basement door, so I believed that all was resolved.
Long story short, the host entered the property on two occasions without knocking or identifying themselves knowing full well we were in the property.  Host was vicious, screaming and yelling.  Threatening and bullying to leave the entire premises.
I contacted AIRBNB support and after 6.5 hours was informed that I would be allowed to stay.  The event we had planned that evening was missed.
I have contacted AIRBNB many times since this incident to ask what they plan to do regarding their host being fradulent and trying to shake me down for more money.  I have yet to receive an answer.  My review of the property and host was never published.  In fact other unfavorable reviews of the property have since disappeared.  The listing has a high star rating and is still in operation.
This screams volumes as to how AIRBNB truly does not care about their customer.  How can anyone trust the reviews?  How can they continue to entertain a host with very severe anger issues?
I have been an AIRBNB customer for 8 years, and will not use or recommend them again.  While my past experiences have been excellent, this company has shown its true colors:  Green = Money.  My safety, comfort and trust means absolutely nothing."

Airbnb offer a full refund or alternative accommodation options (not as nice as our first choice) with a €23 token if we accept the alternative accommodation. No mention of the loss of our flight booking €200.
Very disappointing to say the least."
2024-09-16,1,AirBNB does NOT protect renters ,"Unfortunately, an issue occurred moments after we arrived — one well known to the hosts per the note on the board — making the rental uninhabitable. 

Had we been given full disclosure prior to booking — that the host considers indoor roaches a common occurrence
during summer months — we would have chosen to book elsewhere. 

Securing a refund was neither quick nor easy, but with relentless protestation we were eventually able to make other accommodations for the night.

It is our strong opinion that the presence of live roaches IN a rental unit upon checkin justifies cancellation and full refund — even if the unit was “just treated for roaches yesterday” per the host. That said, AirBNB will issue refund ONLY if the host, regardless of the validity of the request.

No where does it state while booking if you choice partial payment that you will not be refunded if you need to cancel. BEWARE! They were horrible on the phone and the host was insulting and rude when I questioned why I wasn’t receiving my refund as stated when I booked. Refunds are ONLY for reservations that pay in full! 
2024-09-15,1,WARNING,"WARNING: Trust these reviews. Do not use Airbnb, and avoid the host named Helen. She has several properties in Biloxi Mississippi. My complaint concerns Helen's poor attitude and substandard living conditions at her Airbnb. Additionally, the Airbnb customer support team repeatedly charged my credit card without my authorization. Taking money off my credit card when they were not supposed to. This prompted my bank to alert me and necessitate the cancellation of my card.  Do not trust the Airbnb with your card information. They are out to take your money. Regarding the host, Helen, and her Airbnb in Biloxi, Mississippi, her lack of customer service was notable. She made us vacate the Airbnb early and declined to issue a refund. She literally put of out even though we had already paid. I have evidence that she made us leave early without issuing a refund, as Airbnb customer support has sent us a letter apologizing for not properly processing our refund. Furthermore, the state of the Airbnb was not up to par. Helen driveway was unsightly with large potholes. The whole driveway was in need of repair. Also, it is important to highlight that the driveway repairs commenced only following this bad review, however, it still need work done to it. Additionally, the living room futon displayed prominent stains on the cushion, requiring a cover before use because we had no idea what caused the stains. We did know if the stain was human secretions or not. Moreover, the old refrigerator consistently flooded the floor, and its door detached entirely upon opening. Once again, the entire door fell right off the hinges upon being opened. This resulted in some food items spoiling, and even upon departure, it was still not functioning correctly. Regarding Helen, she was a horrible host. If you read her previous reviews on the Airbnb website it reveals descriptions of her as unscrupulous and mentions of her unpleasant demeanor. I sincerely hope my review remains visible, as it's a common concern that some businesses may remove negative reviews. The public has a right to know the truth, and issues can only be addressed when they are exposed. So, I would not recommend anyone to stay at one of Helen Airbnb in Biloxi MS or even the Airbnb company to stay anywhere because the company is untrustworthy. Lastly, I have posted some picture of Helen driveway. I really wish Trustpliot had the ability to post photos. "

2024-09-13,1,HORRIBLE SUPPORT,"I had a highly disappointing experience with Airbnb due to both their policies and support services. I booked a room for 10 days, but upon arrival, I found the room in terrible condition—dirty, infested with spiders and insects, and clearly not as described in the listing. There was even hair on the bed, despite paying over £50 in cleaning fees.

When I raised these issues with the host, they dismissed my concerns, claiming it was normal for UK homes to have spiders, as if that excused the poor cleanliness and misrepresentation.

I contacted Airbnb support for a refund, but my request was declined. I then asked for a partial refund and to modify my stay to just one day. However, Airbnb's policy required the host’s approval first, which is extremely frustrating given that the host had already been dishonest in the listing. After leaving me without help for four hours, Airbnb support finally offered £150 as compensation, which didn’t even cover 20% of my booking costs.

In short, Airbnb's policy protects dishonest hosts at the expense of guests, and their support team is unhelpful when issues arise. If you're considering paying a large sum for an Airbnb, I recommend saving yourself the hassle and opting for a hotel instead, where you’re more likely to get what you pay for."
2024-09-13,1,Airbnb cancelled my accommodation…,"Airbnb cancelled my accommodation booking 9 days before our trip. I’m travelling alone with a small child. They cancelled stating that the place I booked might not meet their standards. They offered me £20 towards my rebooking and suggested places that were 2-4x the price and in different areas of the city. I contacted customer service on chat as I was at work. I received cut and paste nonsense that was of no help in me booking another place that was affordable. £20 wasn’t going to make even a tiny dent in rebooking 9 days in advance when all affordable places were booked out! The customer service agent rang me, though she was difficult to hear and understand. She rushed to say she had refunded my money and repeated their bs offer of a £20 coupon. You could tell she was just reading a script and could care less. She said she would send equivalent properties and proclaimed my issue resolved and hung up. I looked at her suggested properties and cried. They were all insanely expensive! I then got another message saying how happy they were to resolve my issue and they were there for me 24/7. They closed my complaint to their satisfaction. 

Meanwhile, I’m still left high and dry with nowhere to stay with my 5yo daughter, no refund has arrived in my bank account and I’m a week from departure. No more word from them. I am beyond sickened by their services and customer treatment and will NEVER use them again. Worst. Company. Ever. "

Despite a guest causing significant damage to my property, Airbnb's AirCover program has failed to provide any satisfactory solution. I have repeatedly contacted customer service and provided all the necessary information regarding the damage and the extra service fees caused by the guest. However, Airbnb has continuously closed my case or provided irrelevant responses. Days, even weeks have passed, and yet there is still no resolution.

I have also noticed that other hosts have experienced similar issues. Airbnb keeps marking my support requests as ""under review"" and then closes them without offering any real solution. It is unacceptable for such a large platform to neglect such a simple issue that needs to be resolved. Airbnb claims that the damages will be covered under the AirCover program, but in reality, it provides no assurance.

I have suffered financial losses, and my booking revenues have been interrupted due to this issue, yet Airbnb's protection program does not work as promised. I am truly shocked. I will pursue legal action and will do everything in my power to spread awareness of this injustice across all platforms.

I used AirBnB for the first time.
Money was sent to them via PayPal for the selected accommodations.
In short AirBnB said they did not receive the money and so with information from myself and PayPal the tracing of the transaction started.
Over 60 received emails and 12+ hours of phone conversation have resulted in an Angina attack.
I informed them as a result I would not be travelling and I would be claiming for the stress and the related angina as a result of the most unbelievable inept performance by the entire company!!
Today I looked on line to see how I could raise the formal complaint.
The only way, according to the information, is to return to the source of the problem. 
I did this and, once again, came across the same brick wall I had been banging my head against since this dispute started. There is no other way forward as when I looked up their head office the number was exactly the same with no alternative. Help!!!!!!

- Airbnb is terribly pushy and takes unilateral decisions when you refuse to comply. Airbnb imposes decisions on hosts (changing the price I ask per night without asking nor prior warning, etc.) This is MY HOME, not Airbnb's property, and I will decide how much I charge and if and when I rent.
- Tremendous lack of transparency regarding the amount Airbnb actually retains from you AND the guests (they officially say 3%, but it can actually be more like 18%!!)
- Airbnb will almost always take the side of the guests, even when they have not respected CLEARLY STATED HOUSE RULES. They seem to forget that it is the hosts who take the biggest risk, not to mention without hosts and their homes, platforms such as Airbnb would be out of business. 
- Arbitrary decisions without prior warning. When trying to appeal, you are either routed to call centers abroad where no one knows what is happening and cannot help you, or are outright ignored. Impossible to get a clear answer. It appears most messages are automated, or at least sound like bots. My account was unilaterally cancelled without warning, even though I've been a host for 15 years and a superhost for many of those years...
- Airbnb started out as people renting out their own home, but has now mostly been taken over by hotels, conglomerates who rent out many properties, etc. - meaning the original vibe has been lost and the small owner is clearly unimportant to them.

The ability to rate guests is one advantage. While I find Airbnb a much more responsive and responsible company (for example, during COVID they used emergency funds to compensate hosts for cancellations, and BDC just grabbed commission), I have fewer bookings with them with the same text and photos than with BDC. Even when you do get a hold of customer service with BDC, the problem normally is unresolved. AirBnB customer service, at least for super hosts, seems to respond within a few hours. BDC doesn't seem to care about customers or hosts as long as the commission is paid. The same complaints are reported in other hosting groups.  Unfortunately, it's hard to get guests without BDC as they dominate by buying up all top searches in Google. So, hopefully, if AirBnB can be a bit more successful with advertisements and google search results to compete with BDC, it will draw even more customers"

My dog was 11 years old and never destroyed anything because we stayed at several airbnbs with her and never had a problem. Meanwhile the neighbors dog attacked me when going to get groceries from my car and it was the WORST experience ever!

THEN she wanted another 150 on top of the already 475 that I paid. NEVER again will rent from Airbnb. I have found another entity that is more expensive but it’s well worth it.

Airbnb are making it impossible for us to cancel these double booking without being charged a fee. 

This has become worse and worse over the last few months. Hearing they are struggling financially it’s seems convenient they try to enforce non refundable cancellation fees on to the hosts with this cliche in their operations

The kitchen has no kettle, microwave or a pot to make a tea/kofee, broken kitchen chairs, broken laminate floor, the bed creacks badly only on touching. Eather the address location is different! I have informed the AIRBNB About all this illegalities sustained by photos and they looks that 
they don't care about all this bad things and illegalities. This is disgusting they diverted me after two days on chats to resolution centre to solve the problem with the host for compensation. I've said here is not just about compensation is about people health & safety and I'm already sorry for the next his/yours customers.THAT APARTMENT DOESN’T NEED TO BE ON AIRBNB OR OTHER WEBSITES FOR HOLLIDAY’S RENTING ""The AIRBNB are saying that they care about people and want a happy community"" REALLY if is like that take action, close that guy bussines until is safe for humans for the Good sake.

Ridiculous company that wasted my time! It would have made more sense to advise people of this way in advance so we do not spend time on their silly app."
2024-09-06,1,I recently went on holiday to Istanbul…,"I recently went on holiday to Istanbul with my family, rented an apartment advertised on airbnb. When we checked in, it was absolutely filthy, rotten food left from previous guest... To avoid the hassle of finding another apartment, after travelling for quite few hours, we decided to clean it 
ourselves. The host turned out to be an alcoholic, drunk 24 hours a day. He kept harassing us, trying to get us to check out a day earlier, because he was so drunk he probably didn't even know what day it was. To avoid him, we went out for a few hours, and 
when we returned to apartment we realised that the host has entered the apartment and stolen many of our posesions. The door was unlocked with a spare key, so it was him. Airbnb supported us until it was time to compensate for our stolen possessions, which they promised 
they'll do. When contacting them, they just pass you from one person to another, and they all say the same thing, then they become rude as if you owe them money, not the other way round. We haven't received compensation yet, and probably never will. What's worse, that host is still advertising the same apartment on airbnb as normal, even after having quite a few negative reviews. To warn other quests, his name is 'ahmethan', and the address is Küçükayasofya Mahallesi Çakıroğlu Sokak No40 Daire 2 Sultanahmet Istanbul Metehanoğlu. "
2024-09-06,1,Do you want a mess - Host for Airbnb! ,"I have been a host for one year and in that time I have experienced so much confusion, mistakes and uncertainty about reservations that I am going to leave the system today. Any housing policies and rules that you yourself have chosen about reservations cannot be trusted to work, but the guests themselves can change the housing policies that you have set. What is the point of asking for rules for reservations if they don't work and the guests can change them themselves? Under no circumstances should you trust your accommodation to Airbnb unless you want constant mess and confusion in your life. I had my fill today. I would definitely not recommend Airbnb accommodation to anyone. Beware! "

2024-09-04,1,Extreme compensation of tenant,"I am extremely disappointed with Airbnb's handling of our recent booking. We were required to pay a 30% compensation, which is more than what we earn from a booking and is disproportionate to the inconvenience caused. This was our first booking through Airbnb, and we are planning to stop using their platform immediately. They did not listen to the property owner at all, only to the renter.

During the rental, an unexpected problem occurred: the TV and satellite decoder were damaged, likely due to a thunderstorm. This was something we could never have foreseen. As soon as we were notified, both the owner and the property manager acted immediately. The TV was replaced within a day, but it became apparent that the satellite decoder was also broken. Despite our prompt and adequate response to resolve the issue, Airbnb decided on the compensation without even consulting us, simply stating, ""this is our company policy.""

Our job involves solving unforeseen problems that may arise during a rental, such as a TV and decoder damaged by a storm. We do this with great dedication to ensure all our renters fully enjoy their stay. However, not every issue can be resolved within a day. While we understand that compensation might be necessary, 30% is ABSURD. If this is how we have to operate, I might as well close my business tomorrow.

We currently manage 140 properties and have a 60% return rate of guests, demonstrating that customer satisfaction is our number one priority. An action like this by Airbnb is completely absurd and does not reflect a fair approach to both owners and the rental company."

Different dept said all listings would be unsuspended on Sept. 2nd.  Still all suspended.  Review just goes on and on and on...no end in sight.  Going on my 8th Case Manager.  Zero continuity, zero caring, zero company!"
2024-09-03,1,Always an unpleasant surprise.,"While traveling, we encountered several issues that I believe future guests should be aware of. These places were not inexpensive, and our experiences were far from satisfactory.

In Kotor, the accommodation had ants in the kitchen, which was very concerning. Additionally, the location was steep and difficult to access. We were also disturbed daily by a rooster that woke us up at 5 AM, and the neighbors were extremely noisy, making it hard to relax.

In Rome, the host was rude, and to our surprise, the remote for the air conditioning was hidden. This made it difficult to control the temperature in the room. At another location, we saw cockroaches, which was unacceptable. Yet another place had ongoing construction right next to our room, disrupting our stay.

It's frustrating to encounter these issues, especially when you’re paying for what should be a pleasant experience. These hosts seem to be engaging in practices that are not acceptable, and it’s important for future travelers to be aware of these potential surprises. Time and money are valuable, and it’s disappointing to face repeated unpleasant surprises during our travels."
2024-09-03,1,Deceived traveler lost $700,"Unfortunately this was the last time I'm am using AirBnB. Although it is convenient, I am ready to spend more time searching for places in other ways than dealing with you guys.

My last experience was absolutely disasterous and I lost $700 in 1 day.

Context:

I booked a room for 30 days as a temporary place to live after a breakup.

I asked the host if the bathroom is private, and he politely replied that it is shared.

I thought, well, sharing bathroom with another person is not a big deal.

When I arrived host presented me with the fact that there are in total 5 grown man that will be sharing that bathroom.

Nowhere on the listing or during our conversation it wasn't mention. The whole listing looks like ""come live with me in my place"".

This is so deceiving! I would never book the place for such an extended time if I knew that I will live with 5 other people and share a single bathroom. It took me 45 minutes the first night to finally get to the bathroom.

Well, long story short, it took me more than 2 hours of my time with support to get my points across. It took 4 support representatives and 2 days of constant reminding to get any help.

I completely disagree with the resolution, as the host returned me $700 out of $1,500 for 1 night stay.

Why? Because AirBnB decided that if it is mentioned that bathroom is shared, that means the listing is matching description.

My question is, what if there would be 20 people? I understand that it is ridiculous scenario, but it seems to me that Airbnb wouldn't care as well, because it says ""shared"".

For your room bookings you have to enforce including the amount of people living in the property, how many total rooms there is and how many full bathrooms all occupants will share. So your travelers can make an informed decision!

And in this case I strongly believe that support should've been on my side and provide me a prorated refund or cover me with your AIR Cover program.

Very disappointed and surprised about the whole situation.

Never using you again..."

2024-09-02,1,As a long-time SuperHost on Airbnb,"As a long-time SuperHost on Airbnb, I’m extremely disappointed with how poorly Airbnb treats its Hosts. Despite my commitment to providing exceptional hospitality and maintaining a high standard of service, Airbnb has shown that it does not support Hosts at all. They are only interested in collecting service fees, and when issues arise, they leave Hosts to deal with the consequences alone.

Airbnb does not consider the circumstances or the effort that Hosts put into maintaining their properties and ensuring a great experience for guests. They apply penalties without taking into account our side of the situation, even when their own tools, like ""Smart Pricing,"" are to blame for creating issues. This platform is not trustworthy for property owners.

If you are considering listing your property on Airbnb, I strongly advise against it. They do not care about Hosts and provide minimal support when problems arise. Avoid this platform if you value fair treatment and support for your hard work."
2024-09-02,1,Urgent Complaint: Issues with Airbnb Support and Unjustified Blocking of My Experience,"I would like to share an extremely frustrating experience I am having with Airbnb, where I am a provider of boat and kayak tour experiences. For over 20 days now, my experience has been blocked by the platform due to a new policy requiring insurance coverage of $1 million. As a legal and responsible operator in Portugal, I provided all the insurance documents required by Portuguese law, including liability insurance, boat insurance, and personal accident insurance.

After a long wait and numerous attempts to communicate with the support team, I received a response stating that my insurance was not adequate and that a specific ""maritime insurance"" was required. However, in Portugal, there is no insurance with such a designation. Portuguese insurers offer exactly the types of insurance I have already submitted to Airbnb, which are fully legal and valid for operating my business.

I have been trying to resolve this situation for more than 20 days. I have sent several emails, made more than 10 phone calls, and the only response I receive is to ""wait."" The chat with the support team has been unhelpful, with automated or empty responses, without any concrete solution. This incompetence on the part of the support team is causing me daily financial losses, as I cannot operate my experience and am losing customers and revenue.

I demand that Airbnb resolves this situation immediately. As a partner who generates significant revenue for the platform through the commissions paid on each experience sold, I feel disrespected and undervalued by the lack of response and solution. If my insurance is legal and valid in Portugal, and there is no clarity on what type of ""maritime"" insurance is required, Airbnb needs to recognize and accept the documents I have already provided, or give clear and feasible instructions.

I am awaiting an urgent response and the immediate reactivation of my experience. It is unacceptable that a long-term partner is treated this way. I will continue to expose this situation until it is resolved."

2024-09-02,1,Host cancelled last minute then relisted at a higher price,"First time using Airbnb as I have always been sceptical about renting someone else's home rather than booking a hotel. Reservations were justified it would seem.
Host cancelled on a Sunday, two days prior to arrival. Had the option to rebook elsewhere with a £19 credit and the same property was still listed but at a higher price. Cannot leave a review on Airbnb about the host because the reservation was cancelled - they only let you review if you complete the stay.
Very poor customer service from Airbnb, no answer given as to why hosts can cancel last minute and increase prices, no compensation offered for the inconvenience of spending a Sunday afternoon trying to find alternative last minute accommodation unless I rebook with them, which I absolutely will not be doing, plus there was nothing suitable in the same location unless I paid the increased rate for the original booking.
Once I receive the refund owed, which Airbnb have advised can take up to 15 days, I will be closing my account."

We discovered one fo the bedrooms had no real door. Then the shower broke and the water would not turn off. The host promised to bring us batteries since the tv did not work and we could not do our family presentation. Airbnb was nice during this time and called to see how to get things solved and informed me that we would get a partial refund. I asked that they call me after trip so we could do this. They did not. Then I messaged them through their portal a few weeks after trip. the portal crashed and i could not get back in. So I tried later to get this alleged refund, and now they say it has been too long. Even while they never returned my messages. I guess we will find another company to do business with. "

We stayed at a place in Spain and when we left we left a 5* review but noted a few things that could do with improving. Shortly after the host sent us multiple messages verbally abusing us calling us stupid, smarta**, a**hole, to shut the f** up and repetitively threatening us (he has all of our information this is deeply concerning). We contacted Airbnb and raised a case and they spent two weeks investigating, to respond saying the host hadn’t violated any policy and there won’t do anything about this situation, not even an apology. The fact that they allow hosts like this to still operate on their site shows they care more for the money than the safety of their customers. If I could change my review on the host I really would but I will be avoiding Airbnb from now on. Avoid angel in a large villa in Tomelloso in Spain (Argamasilla de Alba)"

2024-08-31,1,I’m urging all potential Airbnb users…,"
I’m urging all potential Airbnb users to beware of extreme negligence that left my family and me in a dire situation. I booked a property in Florida with host Adamo Property Management that was completely uninhabitable—no electricity, no air conditioning, no ability to cook, do laundry, or even have privacy. The conditions were so unsafe that we couldn’t stay in the unit and had to book a hotel at our own expense.

As a mother of two babies, this was an added burden during an already tragic time—I had just lost my daughter and was there for her celebration of life. On top of the emotional distress, we suffered significant financial losses, including spoiled groceries, hotel costs, and paying for an electrician—expenses that Airbnb and the host have refused to compensate after host asked us to pay and promised daily that the maintenance man would arrive.

This experience was a blatant breach of guest safety, habitability, and financial reimbursement rights. Airbnb’s failure to address these issues is shocking and unacceptable. I’m seeking a full refund and compensation, and I urge others to reconsider trusting Airbnb with their travel plans.

The minute we got there we couldn’t go up   It had an elevator which I picked due to traveling with my mother and her nurse fighting stage four lung cancer. The elevator was broken when we got there.  They came and fixed it so we tried to get the luggage upstairs and my nurse got stuck in the 130 degree elevator and the hosts were doing nothing. I called the police and they were told they can not legally rent it. We switched to a supposed upscale large waterfront home. The pictures were very deceiving. The place was a dump that hadn’t been cleaned in I don’t know how long. The whole house stunk like mold. We left knowing we can’t stay anywhere with mold. We stayed 10 minutes and the host was two hours late. I have demanded my 5k plus dollars back for the week I originally paid   They refused to refund anything.   This was my first and last experience with airbnb.  There should be some kind of monitoring of the properties as they are deceivingly marketed.  I don’t think airbnb will be around much longer. Check their reviews. I would I would have before my horrible experience.  "

I had also booked another place with positive reviews only to be told that I couldn't stay there six hours later. So, I had to find another place quickly and hastily booked another place. They took my money immediately. 
Despite other negative reviews and complaints I had found later, I couldn't get a refund, so I decided to give it a chance. I had booked 4 nights and only stayed for 2 because of the lack of sleep, poor quality of the beds and service and so on. Like others, I also complained to Airbnb and got nothing in return and lost money for 2 nights and had to find and pay more moneyfor another small hotel. 
Airbnb allows cowboy hosts and cares little and just takes people's money. No response to my complaints whatsoever. They don't care.

My reservation was cancelled by the landlord on a short notice due to a plumbery issue in the flat which can happen. When I tried to reach out to the customer service in order to resolve the problem/ get a refund, I was contacted by an agent with the biggest hostility and explicitly accusing me of me being dishonest and wishing to cancel my reservation, that I will get no refund as well, all this without contacting the landlord. I was in situation of distress as I was in a foreign country and didnt know what to do, while I was a situation needing the most support, after a stressful conversation with that agent, he finally decided to call the landlord who confirmed the cancellation was from his end. If the land lord did not say the truth I would have lost all my money, my holidays, and potentially spend the night homeless as that place was a very high demand town.

I had booked an apartment which was accepted and all paid but when I had got to the destination after a 7 hour journey and having no food or water I tried getting through to the host and I was made aware this apartment was not available and tenants were living there at that time, the host themselves ignored me when I tried getting through to them and Airbnb took several hours to reply to my calls and sort this situation out. Once the host finally replied after AirBNB contacting them, he stated that he is unsure why we were able to book. This makes no sense as we booked 5 days prior to arriving so surely he would have seen the money come to his account? Or even an email confirming that someone has booked. We were given no indication that the apartment would have been unavailable as we were sent a confirmation stating that the host had accepted it. It was 8pm and I was sitting at a abandoned bus stop with my luggage, bearing in mind I’m a young girl and anything could have happened especially considering I am in a area I have never been too! Alternative solutions were provided from Airbnb which consisted of apartments that were 1-2 hours away from where I had booked and pre planned activities had to be cancelled, due to this it resulted in me losing out on £200 as I did not get this money back! Even with these alternation apartments provided, it was not certain I would have this apartment for sure as they told me to call the host and ask if they can have me so I was still stranded on the street finding solutions. They also said they would not pay for my travel to the other apartments which were more than an hour away when I was not at fault so service was disgustingly poor! They also failed to compensate me on my experience. I will never be booking with them again. I’m waiting patiently for their downfall!!!"

Airbnb do fix problems if you make them aware of it but sometimes it’s just not worth the hassle or it’s simply too late to do anything about it other than ask for a credit or refund,  but I run into these problems increasingly with lazy hosts on AirBnB. 
One apartment I booked was still occupied when I went to check-in so the absent host used a friend to shuffle me off to her other apartment which had no furniture! with just an ensemble mattress on the floor. Also the photos of the apartments interiors on airbnb  are often not the same as when you check-in. Definitely not letting it fly anymore.  My previous stay had black mould all over the bathroom tiles and I had to complain and get a cleaner in  immediately on arriving. Again, it’s just absent,  lazy hosts who don’t check up on cleaning and maintaining the property. There is no excuse for it, Hosts can get the caretakers/cleaners to send photos to prove the property is ready etc but honestly the Host should be there. All in all, hosts should be present but most of the time the hosts are not in town or not even in the country! they are nowhere to be seen and that is the problem with Airbnb. Airbnb should have a policy of banning remote hosting altogether. "
2024-08-26,1,Airbnb not to be trusted - money grabbers ,Airbnb actually makes its rules up to please their situation. Having spent over an hour asking for them to show ‘where in their policy’ do they actually state what they are telling me - the answer is nowhere!  They only want to make money out of guests and hosts - support tells lies to cover themselves. Go and book/host through another platform. 
2024-08-26,1,Awful handling of safety concern ,"Turned up at a flat in Berlin to find cameras and monitoring devices everywhere inside the flat (Airbnb policy is that this is not allowed, even if the devices are switched off). I rang Airbnb who confirmed this is a safety concern and said they would pull us out of the flat immediately. Airbnb then went silent for about 4 hours, despite repeated attempts to get them on the phone and via the messaging platform. Because we didn't have enough money to just book somewhere else ourselves, me and my friends (females) were left in a flat we didn’t feel safe in overnight (we used every pair of socks we had to try cover all the cameras). Airbnb then rang me at midnight and admitted they had made an error in processing our move so it couldn't happen until the next day. The host then tried to take money out of my account so I had to cancel all my bank cards while in a foreign country, and Airbnb said this had nothing to do with them so they wouldn't help me. This was all extremely distressing. Airbnb promised a full refund, but I’ve only been given a partial refund, which they calculated incorrectly twice. I’ve also had multiple messages and emails ignored, and been spoken to rudely on the phone by about 12 different Airbnb staff. To top it all, they allowed the host straight back on the platform and allowed him to give me a negative review. I haven't ever dealt with such an awful level of customer service and I was shocked that even when they admit someone has broken their policies, tried to steal from you, and film you without your consent, this individual can be allowed back on the platform hosting the same property out. My friends and I have agreed we will never use Airbnb again."
2024-08-26,1,AIR BNB SUPPORT IS NON EXISTENT,"I second the opinion of several people who have reported that Air BNB offer no support whatsoever when you need it.  There were three of us in the age group 68 to 75 in Cuba, a couple of days before we were to go to our accommodation in Cancun we were informed by our host we couldn't go due to no water availability in the building. We tried to book alternative accommodation with only a few days to spare but received a message to say can't book through their site in Cuba, we were due to arrive Cancun around midnight. We requested assistance but kept getting standard message we are doing all we can to help or we have escalated your problem but actually doing absolute zero. We wasted several days of our holiday in Cuba trying to resolve the issue through them. We were abandoned by them and no follow up to see if we managed to secure accommodation. DO NOT USE!"
2024-08-26,1,Airbnb promotes fake news through its policy// Airbnb fördert durch seine Policy Fake News ,"I have been a superhost with Airbnb for years and am usually very satisfied with the work and the guests. However, it sometimes (very rarely) happens that guests simply demand their money back by making demonstrably false claims. Instead of investigating the case properly, as a host you are completely left in the lurch by Airbnb and hung on the rope of a guest's lies, which is more than unpleasant. Airbnb is always on the side of the guest, even if obviously false information is provided, and then justifies this with freedom of expression. Behind this is the fact that superhosts are “bludgeoned” into even greater efforts by these bad reviews or payments and that the company doesn't care about the people/hosts at all. Even the support team admits that Airbnb relies on a self-serving model. But anyone who invests a lot as a super host so that guests are completely happy is demotivated and undermined by this system and the extremely negative experiences it causes. Customer loyalty looks completely different!

Ich bin seit Jahren Superhost bei Airbnb und meistens sehr zufrieden mit der Arbeit und den Gästen. Allerdings kommt es manchmal (sehr selten) vor, dass Gäste unter der Angabe nachweislich falscher Behauptungen einfach Geld zurückverlangen. Statt dann den Fall richtig zu prüfen, wird man als Gastgeber von Airbnb völlig im Stich gelassen und am Strick der Lügen eines Gastes aufgehängt, was mehr als unangenehm ist. Airbnb steht immer auf der Seite des Gastes, auch wenn offensichtlich falsche Angaben gemacht werden und rechtfertigt das dann mit Meinungsfreiheit. Dahinter steht das Superhosts von diesen schlechten Bewertungen oder Zahlungen zu noch größeren Anstrengungen „geknüppelt“ werden und das die Menschen/Hosts dem Konzern dabei völlig egal sind. Selbst der Support gibt zu, dass Airbnb auf ein Self-Serving Modell zugreift. Aber wer als Superhost viel investiert damit Gäste rundum glücklich sind, wird durch dieses System und die davon verursachten extrem negativen Erfahrungen demotiviert und ausgehöhlt. Kundenbindung sieht vollkommen anders aus! "
2024-08-26,1,Review removed,I had a guest contact me with bogus cleaning and maintenance complaints after they checked out.  I have a clear policy that requires issues to be submitted at check in or during their stay so they can be remediated immediately. The guest took apart my sofa and took photos of the inside electronics for the recliner claiming it was dirty.  They wanted a refund in exchange for a good review.  I declined and posted an honest review of the guest warning hosts and Airbnb removed my review.
2024-08-26,1,Major bug infestation!,"Stayed with hosts Wendy and Thomas in Corpus Christi, Texas July 26-31, 2024 and left with over a hundred bed bug bites.  Ended up with a severe allergic reaction that required emergency treatment.  The guest after us also reported bites.  Airbnb did nothing to assist, said I reported the problem too late which was not the case.  I am out nearly $2,000 Cdn for this fiasco.  Airbnb takes no responsibility for this.  DO NOT STAY AT THIS PLACE!! "
2024-08-25,3,Host attempted to cancel 6 hours before check in,"I’ve just had a horrific experience with an Airbnb host. Was basically told she had to cancel my booking just 6 hours before our scheduled check in. By that time of course we were already on our way. In the end, it all got sorted but undue stress was already caused. Airbnb support actually stepped in and helped tremendously. I just don’t think I’ll be using Airbnb again after this though as the experience has really shaken me up especially that I was travelling with small children and to be told we potentially did not have a place to stay for the night was very stressful!"

We didn't feel safe, secret door behind a curtain he was entering through. Too small girls with our party, not acceptable. Air BnB did nothing about it and seemingly accept that not only is it acceptable for hosts to go through your stuff whilst you're out but also to allow small children to properties where they are not safe. Utterly disgusted. Have used them for years. Will not be doing again. Keep your belongings and family safe! 

Avoid the host Marin with rental properties in Croatia. Especially 'Floyd' dingy, horrible, unsafe place. "
2024-08-25,1,Avoid Gift Cards,Not only did this company waste my time and money booking but they refuse to accept my credit card so I bought $800 of gift cards in which they flagged and shut down my account saying that I wasn’t representing myself authentically which I have no clue what that means nor did I care they did not let me dispute and they did not Refund my gift cards the balances were used and not able to be spent so this company costed me $800!
2024-08-24,1,I was an Airbnb host for over 10 years…,"I was an Airbnb host for over 10 years and watched Airbnb fall apart. Initially, it was a great way to find a nice summer roommate or guest. Over the years, the whole platform became more and more complicated for everyone, which led to a lot of confusion, bookings made in error, and difficulty accurately communicating expectations, both for guests and hosts. The support for hosts is just as abysmal as it is for guests. The policies are there to protect Airbnb, not the host or the guest. Forget customer service--the folks who pick up the phone might as well be bots--they read from a script. It takes weeks to get a person to speak with you who can resolve your issue--if they want to resolve it at all. I'm sure that most if not all of the negative reviews here are accurate. I quit hosting almost a year ago and while I lost the revenue, I regained sanity."
2024-08-24,1,Airbnb - poor communication ,"Airbnb's customer support department and complete lack of basic communication is a major problem, whenever I have had an issue with a guest they have decided to side with and not bothered to have a discussion with myself or communicate on suspending a listing which they advised to reactivate and then have not with zero communication from a support team member or management. 5 days and counting awaiting a team member to contact me

I am not surprised they have lost market share based on below average customer service and will co tinue to do so."

2024-08-24,1,Guests don't matter to Airbnb from our experience. ,"Unprofessional, unprepared host, encouraged us to call her directly (avoiding documentation on Airbnb) and then told two different stories, I have documented both. After she sent out the bug man (yes, it had ants, even in the cupboards, on the counters, table in the kitchen, we felt things crawling on us in the living room), we never stopped contacting the host. We wanted to have many family dinners together but that plan got thrown out with the rest of our plans to enjoy spending time together in a nice clean home. The fridge didn't have ants. Upon arrival I sent the host pics of stains on the white carpet going from the garbage can in the kitchen to the front door - more ant invitation! A previous review mentions trash not being removed. Then the A/C gave out and we were expected to cancel our birthday plans to meet the repairman. There were thick layers of dust on the filter that should have been changed out in March 2024. So that filthy filter pumped lots of dirt into the air conditioning all summer long. No wonder it broke. Costly oversight. Our trip was ruined. Airbnb didn't help expect to keep us on the phone for hours during our trip and offer to refund the cleaning fee and a third of the first day. We found other accommodations elsewhere but even though the host promised to make everything that was going wrong - right, she failed to follow through and then left us a terrible review - that we lied and twisted her words and Airbnb didn't help us even though we had videos, pictures, texts messages. We will be choosing hotels from now on. This was such a precious time for my family and I. Did the host or did Airbnb care even at the least - no. Guests just don't matter. We would have had way more time together at a hotel - bug free, air conditioning that works, professional hospitality personnel, and we would not be expected to pick up trash all over the driveway and the landscape as well as on the back patio upon arrival.

I contacted Airbnb and informed them I would be contacting a solicitor on my return to UK, they agreed a refund after a lot of communication messages phone calls etc, then they informed me it could only be refunded in the way of credit as the ambassador got it wrong and could only be refunded as credit, I explained after this do you think I would ever use Airbnb again.
I also informed them I would still be seeking legal adivce and the attitude of the ambassador was rude and not interested.

2024-08-23,1,GO TO CHURCH AND BY SOME VALIUM,"Unbelievably airbnb customer service who have failed to resolve my issue, failed to listen to one bit of what I said, phoned me at 22.15 on Wednesday night when I had just dropped off to sleep. I went mad at them for being so stupid and insensitive. They sent notes yesterday apologising profusely . Unbelievably , (apologies I am struggling to express this in words)
they phone me again last night at ten passed midnight, saying I believe you have an issue. Then apologisng again. Reading this you probably think this is not possible, by even the worst company, but its true, Completely true. Unbelievable !
As mentioned I am sure many customers have a great time and benefit with AIRBNB and save money. All I recommend is that if you have an issue, please go to church first and prey, the go to the doctors and get a prescription for valiun it may calm you nerves, before you engage with their customer service ambassadors

2024-08-23,1,"As a Host dismayed by their so-called ""Support"" ","As a Host, I would like to give them a zero. So-called ""Specialized Team Support"" has once again been a dead end. They claim to be ""working on"" a problem and then do not give any answers and have my calendar blocked for tonight and tomorrow night when the dates are actually available. Over half a work day has passed. Nothing. I'll probably lose a few hundred dollars. They need to open calendars for OPEN DATES. If they want to block COMPLETION of a reservation for days that they're still trying to apply their convoluted cancellation policies to, fine. 
It is so wrong to VANISH and let time pass with no availability showing when in fact weekend days are available. Their arrogance is breathtaking. This has happened before. It is very disappointing to feel abused by their ""Support."" The worst part of having an Airbnb once again is dealing with their carousel of what comes across as passive-aggressive sadists.
Postscript: At 7:30 am this morning, Airbnb messaged they had ""ALREADY"" updated the travelers' itinerary and are showing tonight and Saturday available at my property. The right word is FINALLY -- 12 hours AFTER THEY SHOULD HAVE OPENED MY CALENDAR FOR THIS WEEKEND. If they don't want me to complete a reservation until they have worked out details of the clueless guests' itinerary, they can block me from the final step of confirming as their ambassador works out matters UNRELATED TO MY PROPERTY. When I immediately offered a 2 night refund last evening on a last minute cancellation, those two nights should have shown as available IMMEDIATELY so travelers on Thursday evening planning Friday-Saturday travel in great mountain weather could at least inquire.

They owe it to Hosts to let travelers IMMEDIATELY see dates that both host and guest have AGREED are available. I deplore their bureaucratic convoluted hell-for-hosts DELAYS COSTING TIME, FRUSTRATION AND PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.

Airbnb took it down, and now the host is twisting the situation, falsely claiming I wanted payment for a positive review. In reality, I was just asking for reimbursement for the damage.

2024-08-22,1,Profits over Truth,"Recently stayed with a host that was very clearly defrauding us. They staged “damage” that occurred from our stay but had faked the damage themselves after we had left. A deep dive into the host’s reviews ended up revealing a pattern of similar behaviour and other scams. After trying to claim over $800 in damages for a window blind that had been taken off the track, we tried to resolve the issue with Airbnb, showing that we had made the host aware of issues that we did find present (there was a tear in the couch and the dryer wasn’t functioning) but this damage was not us. We also showed them the multiple other instances of shady business the host had done. Airbnb originally claimed that there wasn’t sufficient evidence to find us responsible but they were going to reimburse the host themselves and close the matter. Fast forward a few days later and now Airbnb is claiming we are fully responsible and need to reimburse them for the money they sent the host. The lack of consistency and what honestly just seems like trying to make back their money in spite of lack of clear evidence shows they can be just as shady as the hosts they collect their fees from. Airbnb had become a platform where this stuff is permitted as long as they get their cut, and the customer is left to pick up the bill. I unfortunately can’t trust their service team to have my back, so I won’t be using their services again. "

AirBnB requires me to take photos of my 5000+ items between every visit in order to be able to show a before/after photo of the item destroyed by the guests.

I have hosted a girl in my home while I was away. Since she never extended for another month as she claimed and never responded I have sent my friends there with a spare key to understand whats going on and check on my apartment. 
After they went inside they found my place in a HUGE mess. Cocaine, pills, open needles, puke on carpets and the walls, blood on the mattress, towels and couch etc. It was obvious that her and her boyfriend (who nobody ever paid the stay for or even mentioned) werent only using drugs but also sold it.
Since we assumed they would come back to fetch their stuff we decided immediately to call the police and change the locks so they wouldnt have access anymore.
Her boyfriend arrived after a few hours and thank god wasnt able to enter the place again. 
After he tried to run away from my friends (and threatened them and the security guy of the building with a knife) he finally got arrested by the police at some point. Unfortunately he got out on bail and is missing since (never appeared for his court dates). The girl is nowhere to be found and broke into a locked closet of mine and stole multiple items. 

Not only am I now scared to be back home but I am still waiting for my reimbursement by airbnb (its been a month).

He left me a bad review talking on behalf of his parents.

The host name is Tom Murphy. This was booked and paid for in full back in February on Agoda but his property is also on here so reviewing here too. 
We arrived in Belfast on Friday the 16th of August. My partner had messaged the day before to check how to check in. We received an email when we had already arrived in Belfast to say the accommodation had been “double booked” and they could not accommodate us. That’s was it! So here we are stuck in Belfast (we live near Leeds) with nowhere to stay. All hotels left were £300-£400 upwards per night! We were there for the Liam Gallagher gig so it’s quite obvious to me that this host wasn’t aware of this when we booked back in February and he obviously realised he could up his price. Why not message us in advance to cancel? Its disgusting that accommodations do this when events are on but at least we wound have had the option to find something. We literally had to take what was left and ended up having to spend over £700 on hotels. It was absolutely disgusting. Do not book with Agoda but more so, avoid Tom Murphy at all costs. Absolutely disgusting. We are taking this further. Imagine if it was a couple of young ones going for a trip away and they were stranded like that?"

Final amount to pay £840 which is £100 to AirBnB and the extra to have the place cleaned again.

Arrived at the air bnb and called the host only for the host to angrily explain he hasn't owned the property in over 2 years and was certainly not renting out to people as he'd informed air bnb multiple times before.

I called air bnb three times; the first time the representative refunded us, and sent us alternate locations over an hour away from where we were originally staying and had everything planned ( it was a beach town vacation). We replied that that was not acceptable and he suggested to find a hotel on our own and submit the receipt to them. How unbelievable. They messed up by listing an unavailable property and expected us to find a solution?? I said as much and there was silence before the call was ended on their end. 

I called back and the second time I was promised a representative would call back with options and guess what? Hpurs and no call back. Third time I called and explained the situation, the representative said she would look for a hotel or some other place for me to stay in. And of course, I'm still waiting with no response. It's 8:30pm and no place to stay on vacation. I've had to cancel my plans to return home and air bnb had not offered any compensation. This is a completely untrustworthy and irresponsible company. Will not be using them ever again or recommending them to others as the treatment and disrespect was unbelievable. "
2024-08-15,1,Avoid at all costs. Truly awful & totally unreliable.,"Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
I have had more cancellations from hosts than actual stays. Nothing is guaranteed even if you pay unlike hotels. If he hosts can just cancel as they wish, even if it’s one week before your holiday - just like they did with me. I’ve had 3 cancellations over the past 6 months. It’s crazy how a business can be run like this. 

I think it’s astonishing that I’ve have more cancellations than actual stays with Airbnb. Hardly very reliable is it? Imagine if you had plane tickets booked. You’d be screwed! 

The latest cancellation caused me a huge amount of stress trying to find alternative more reliable companies to spend my hard earned money with.

 I am very unlikely to use Airbnb again and wouldn’t recommend to any of my friends or family. Truly awful & totally unreliable."

These checks do not use enough identifying information to correctly verify the results. The company Inflection has had numerous complaints and judgments for their poor performance. Airbnb just accepts an incorrect report and then tells you to contact Inflection. Airbnb chose this poor provider and tells the customer sorry it isn’t our problem. Bad companies contract bad companies!
2024-08-15,1,I deleted my account,"I deleted my account, which I used as a host and traveler for 9 years. They want tax number, but they not pay any taxes. As the host, I wanted to cancel the reservation while the customer still had 20 days left. But airbnb wants a 90 Euro penalty from me! Clearly fraud!"
2024-08-14,2,Inadequate Response from Airbnb to Unresolved Host Issues,"I am writing to formally lodge a complaint against Airbnb for their failure to address and resolve serious issues related to my current stay at an Airbnb property. Despite multiple attempts to rectify the situation directly with the host and seeking assistance from Airbnb's customer support, the problems have persisted, leading to considerable inconvenience and distress.

I booked an Airbnb property with the expectation that it would meet the standards and amenities outlined in the listing and as per Airbnb's policies. Unfortunately, upon arrival, I discovered several issues that have made my stay deeply uncomfortable. Firstly, the apartment was poorly cleaned, with a foul odor throughout the space. The poor ventilation in the apartment exacerbates this issue, making it difficult to get fresh air and creating an unpleasant living environment. Additionally, the common areas of the building are poorly maintained, with both the hallways and other shared spaces being inadequately cleaned and emitting unpleasant smells.

Furthermore, the property was severely under-equipped, with several essential items missing. The missing items include:

Cleaning supplies (broom, bucket, cleaning cloths, and cleaning products)
A trash bin for the bathroom
Dish towels
Sufficient pots and cooking utensils
A kettle
Bath towels for a two-week stay
Bathroom mats

It occurred on: 10/08/2024

I promptly communicated these issues to the host, requesting that the missing items be provided immediately. However, the host failed to address the majority of my concerns. The reception at the building provided only one bath towel and one pot, which is entirely inadequate. I was further informed that I would need to contact the host directly for any additional items, which I did, but to no avail.

In a particularly humiliating experience, I was directed by the host to visit the building’s reception, where a staff member led me to a cluttered room filled with various items resembling a pile of trash. I was told to pick out anything I needed for the apartment, leading me to take one bath towel, some plates, bowls, and a pot. This experience was demeaning and far from the standard of service and accommodation I expected.

Despite raising these issues with Airbnb's support team, I have not received an adequate resolution. The host has not fulfilled their obligations, and Airbnb has not provided the necessary intervention to rectify the situation or offer alternative accommodation that meets the expected standards.

I am seeking assistance in ensuring that Airbnb takes immediate and appropriate action to resolve this matter. Specifically, I request that Airbnb enforce the provision of the missing essential items, particularly the cleaning supplies, or facilitate a move to a suitable alternative accommodation that meets the promised standards. If Airbnb fails to resolve this issue, I believe it reflects a systemic problem with their customer service and host accountability practices.

I look forward to your prompt response on this matter.

2024-08-14,1,Extremely disappointed  - Scam,"I am extremely disappointed with how Airbnb handled my dispute. Despite clear evidence, they chose to side with the host, a decision that defies all logic. The resolution system seems more designed to protect hosts than to deliver justice to guest (cash cow).

It’s alarming how Airbnb can overlook obvious facts. One has to wonder if the resolution service actually works or if it’s just a front to justify arbitrary decisions.

As it stands, this system feels more like a well-disguised scam than a reliable platform. Airbnb seriously needs to rethink how they handle disputes.

""A bit more common sense wouldn’t hurt."""
2024-08-14,1,Don't do Airbnb - I tried for 2 months,"OK, so we ended up between houses. That's a family of four, 2 kids 12 and 15. ""lets do airbnb for 2 months"" says husband. It was horrible. Expensive, hosts demanding, and gave miserable reviews. First of all, tried to book stuff which turned out to be ""unavaliable"" but only found this out AFTER money was taken. Hosts can basically have ANY house rules they like ( extensive amounts of cleaning, very early check outs, cleaning requirements etc , just anything they feel like really) and there is nothing to protect the guest. Check out times always woefully early. One host complained we checked out late by an hour - yes, I had 5 massive bags to get down 4 flights of stairs by 10 am on a Saturday - no parking outside and then got a bad review. I was also expected to ""put the sheets on to wash if you have time (smiley face)"" I mean, I AM THE GUEST HERE!!!!!!!!!!!! Never again. Airbnb is all in the hosts favour. They can ask what they want of the guests in the guise of ""house rules"", they can advertise without the property even being AVALIABLE. In the course of 2 months this happened 3 times!!!!. They take your money and not refund you for several days. In some cases this was over £1,000. AVOID, Go to a proper establishment where you actually get rights and some service and even get to book something that actually exists. I have removed myself from this horrible toxic lying platform. I suggest you do the same."
2024-08-14,1,USELESS COMPANY DO NOT LISTEN AND ARE…,USELESS COMPANY DO NOT LISTEN AND ARE IN COMPETENT 
2024-08-14,1,My friends and I had rented an…,"My friends and I had rented an apartment in Dubrovnik, and I had already spoken with the owner, confirming that we would check in at 8:00 PM since our boat was scheduled to arrive at the Dubrovnik port around that time. However, the owner canceled the reservation at 7:00 PM, leaving us with almost no time to find alternative accommodation in the city. Airbnb's initial solution was to find another apartment, but due to the late hour and limited options, we couldn't secure anything.

After informing Airbnb support that we were unable to find another place, they suggested booking a hotel room (which, at that time, were all very expensive) and offered us an additional $300 to cover hotel costs. We understood that this $300 was meant to cover both nights we had originally booked in Dubrovnik.

The only option we found was an apartment on Booking.com that was much more expensive than the one we had booked through Airbnb ($811). Additionally, because of how late it was, we had to eat at a restaurant, which cost more than we had planned, and we also had to get an Uber because the new apartment was far from where we initially intended to stay.

To make matters worse, the address of the Airbnb apartment we originally rented was very unclear. This caused us to wander around, walking a lot, and when the Uber dropped us off at what we thought was the correct location, we had to climb numerous stairs—Dubrovnik is full of them. This led to a friend of ours, who has a back injury, asking us to urgently find a pharmacy for painkillers because his pain became unbearable.

All of this happened around midnight in a city we had never been to before, putting us in a potentially dangerous situation, including the risk of being robbed or worse.

I demand that Airbnb reconsider the entire case and the way they handled the situation that night in Dubrovnik, as it was dealt with in a very inhumane manner."
2024-08-14,1,Unsafe & False Advertising,"Due to flight delays we got to our Airbnb late Friday night. A 4x4 or AWD was critical to navigate the roads to the cabin but not emphasized enough. The roads had swells and got slick with mud. Navigating them in the dark was tricky and our party got lost even when using Airbnb’s map. A neighbor had to tell us how to find the place. We noticed a leak in the basement wetting the carpet when we arrived. We contacted the owner about the leak the next morning. The next day we noticed the leak was considerably bigger. Than, walking around the cabin we noticed there was no usable firepit with benches, a usable gazebo, or a usable zipline & pond like advertised in the Airbnb photos. A leak in the basement made the family room unusable, which was the only room in the house for a large group of people to relax in. There was a leak under the kitchen sink making a puddle to the floor. Foul odors were coming from 2 of the rooms like something had died, grime covered the kitchen table, and dirt plugged up air filters downstairs to the point they weren’t working properly. 

The owner got back to us and said he was calling their handyman. The handyman showed up Monday, 2 days later. We had family who flew in from Texas for the weekend and we did not get what we paid for. The house was not in a safe condition. The place seemed to be in a state of disrepair and neglect. The photos on Airbnb’s website for this property should either be updated or removed due to inaccuracy. We would have left the next day, but the owners were so slow getting back to us with a solution and we had so little time with our family that we just made do and kept the kids out of the basement. We requested an $800 refund. Not quite half of the cost because we only got about half of the service. Airbnb told us they were only mediators and couldn’t offer more than $250 discount from the buyer or $375 from Airbnb itself. Since we are able to back up all these issues with photos I told Airbnb Customer Service to have a Supervisor call me because I wanted the full amount requested. The Airbnb rep on the phone said he was only authorized to offer us $375. I was told a supervisor would call yesterday, then again today. It is now 6:30pm where I am and no call. My next step is to take it up with my credit card company to see if I have any recourse.

2024-08-13,1,Why isn’t there a category for zero…,"Why isn’t there a category for zero stars?

Was in Paris for 2 days - for the Olympics.  Made my reservation approx a year ago.  Turned up, no code and entry.  Tried to call the host, no luck.  Called airbnb and the guy told me I’d have to wait an hour.  After an hour, they could not get hold of the host but apparently he just cancelled the booking.


Airbnb offered me 3 options ‘apparently’ nearby, similar offering and pricing.  Not true and I was already late for a meeting without traipsing round Paris in mid 30s C heat, with bags.  So I found a hotel, luckily.  Bear in mind, it’s the Olympics so imagine the surge pricing.  For airbnb to try and compare their pathetic ‘similar price and similar offering in the same area’ is laughable. 

My ‘amazing’ compensation was a full refund plus a whole 20% off my next booking.  And up to EUR50 off a snack/drinks.  You have to be kidding me with the ‘next booking’. 

I was asked for a review.  Wrote it over a week ago, still not published.  Wonder about the transparency???????

Apparently the host was ‘punished’ by not being able to rent out the apartment for the days I was meant to be there and he lost his superhost status.  That’s it?  Seems like they care more about him than my experience.

Meanwhile, I had a rude person in customer ‘support’ call me and was basically patronising and accusatory.  I got some money back from my cafe but not all (ie not the tip).  They sent a link but no explanation why no hotel refund nor why no tip.  When I asked, they just cut and pasted the response.  Why I would even think about using this company again after this horrific incident is beyond me. 

As companies go, mistakes happen.  How airbnb addresses issues is the sign of its worth. Judging by my experience and reading some of the other reviews, I have to wonder about why this company is still in existence.  

As someone who runs her own company and knows how important our customers are for the longevity of the business, this is a sure fire way of guaranteeing this company is entering the ‘SELL’ recommendation or is ripe for a LT downgrade in ratings.  AND they don’t seem to care…."

2024-08-13,1,As an Airbnb host,"As an Airbnb host, I’ve had an incredibly disappointing experience with the company. Despite their promises of support and security for property owners, they have proven to be completely irresponsible.

When issues arose with a guest who caused significant damage to my property, Airbnb’s response was frustratingly slow and inadequate. They failed to provide any meaningful assistance or compensation, leaving me to handle the situation on my own. It’s clear that Airbnb does not prioritize the well-being of their hosts, despite us being a crucial part of their business.

Their customer service is virtually nonexistent, with long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and a complete lack of accountability. It feels like they are more interested in collecting their fees than in actually supporting the hosts who make their platform possible.

If you’re considering renting out your property on Airbnb, I would strongly advise against it. The risks far outweigh any potential benefits, and you’re likely to be left without support when you need it most."

2024-08-12,1,I booked an Airbnb in Brighouse for my daughter and her partner and it all went pearshaped…,"I booked an Airbnb in Brighouse for my daughter her partner and their dog.  I told the host about their dog which is a support dog for my daughter and was also classed as hypoallergenic.  The host accepted this and all was well until after they had booked in.

My husband I went with them to book in and I was horrified to find that they could not use the lounge because it had no furniture and the kitchen because it had no utensils, crockery, cutlery or cooking equipment and the cooker was disconnected.

We all returned to my home and I sent an email complaining about this which I now admit it was a bit 'over the top' as I was so disappointed and upset.

I then received the following message from the host to say that,

""Airbnb are fully aware of the violations within this stay, and that you have vacated.
*using areas within my home that are not included within my listing. (Living room/kitchen including fridge)
* allowing a dog to roam freely around the whole property again when I have not included that space and ask specifically not to as I have severe allergies.
I will now go ahead and have to have my whole apartment cleaned thoroughly.""

I think the word 'violations' is hard as no body had shown any disrespect to his property, only looking in the lounge to find it was totally lacking in furniture and looking in the kitchen to find that there were no utensils, crockery, cutlery or cooking equipment there.) I don't think the word 'used' is appropriate here - they did not use it, they only looked.  He accepted their dog so long as it was not allowed on go on the furniture/bed which they strictly adhered to.  She slept on a blanket on the floor.

At that stage, before we received his email, due to my mistake, none of us had realised we were doing any wrong.

Later he saw my daughter in the street and told her that he had seen a black dog lead in the lounge window sill - he hadn't because her lead was red!

I was horrified to say the least when I read his comments but I now know that it was all my fault and I explained that I had seen the lovely photos of his accommodation and was concerned that someone else would book it first.  In my anxiety, I failed to read some of the information that the lounge and kitchen were not to be used because of ongoing renovations.

I emailed back and apologised most profusely for my complaint and told him that it was a genuine mistake in booking his apartment.  I also told him that this was supposed to be a special treat for my daughter (who, incidentally, has had a life-threatening diagnosis - I told him this in another email). She lives in Cornwall and it is two years since I saw her and her family due to various problems with my and my husband's health. 

He then phoned me and said I could pay the full amount and not use the lounge or kitchen, or they could leave immediately and I would receive reimbursement for the nights they did not stay.
 
I told him that they would move out immediately which they did, but I did not receive the whole amount.  This I did not query as I was extremely upset at the time and wanted an end to the whole stressful experience.

I gave an excellent review of his accommodation, not mentioning the strong words he used such as violations and his severe allergies 'so he would have to have the apartment cleaned thoroughly' and saying they had been 'using' the rooms.  They had not because they were definitely unusable. 
I thought that was the end of it but I was very wrong. 

He then gave me the following review:

""Unfortunately I would not recommend Bronwen to other hosts. Bronwen and Family completely over stepped the mark by ignoring my house rules using parts of my home that is not included even though this was made clear at time of booking! Allowing there dog to freely roam my home when I had kindly allowed the dog to stay in the rooms designated at the time of booking. I was left with no choice but to end  their stay early.""

He did not end the stay early, I did""  He offered to let them stay if I paid extra, so because of the unusable areas, I told them they would leave immediately, which they did.

I assume that now if I try to book an Airbnb, no one will want to accept it.  I am really disappointed about the whole experience of the last few days.

To my complete surprise, despite Airbnb accepting my gift card on my account, I was informed my account had been suspended! Reason being and I quote...
""We’ve removed you from the Airbnb platform because your account is closely associated with a person who isn’t allowed to use Airbnb"".  
No further explanations have been forthcoming.
Customer services have been totally useless in dealing with this issue and have no interest in sorting it out.  They won't tell me when my account will be reactivated, if ever, and won't refund my £150.  How can it be morally right for a company to accept customers' money and then not allow their customers access to it?!!  It is theft.  
I feel sad and annoyed that my son's gift to me, has gone into the pockets of a morally corrupt company. I would not recommend Airbnb at all and would give them 0 stars if it was possible. WARNING to other users to check your account is active before adding any gift cards.  Also be aware that account status can change at any time without notice or reason. "

2024-08-11,1,Very damp apartment,"The AirBnB in Seville hosted by Pablo (Cozy Studio in Santa Cruz Quarter. Santa Teresa I) had misleading advertising as a good accommodation. The apartment was very damp. It felt humid and smelled very damp. We had to put on the dehumidifier 24 hours a day for the time we were there and we had to empty it multiple times a day including the middle of the night. The damp had damaged the skirting boards,  the windowsills and all the cabinets in the kitchen. There was mould growing on the skirting boards and on the exposed brickwork. We also were not made aware of the fact there was construction directly opposite the AirBnB that would start extremely early in the morning and would wake up from our sleep. We noticed that there were small black stones in the tap water so elected to drink only bottled water. The sofa was covered in several stains. As a result we decided against sitting on the sofa during our stay. The towels were also stained. Unfortunately, we left our wallet in the accommodation by accident. When the wallet was eventually returned to us, all the cash had been removed from the wallet. 

Two positives we can say about this rental was the girl who met us to let us into the apartment was very friendly and the apartment was in a fantastic location."

Of course I tried that but the host said he has no idea what I’m taking about. I asked him why he is listing a property he doesn’t own.  No reply. 

I asked airbnb what proof they ask that a person owns a property when they list it, I am shocked to learn that as long as they sign an agreement saying they are the owners then they can list it. 

So hypothetically speaking I could list a property I don’t own, sign the agreement , start taking bookings and the money and when the real owners find out they have to ask me to take it down.  

That’s wrong and it needs to change. 

If anyone out there is experiencing the same please please let’s get together and get this changed.

2024-08-09,2,I would not recommended Airbnb,"I would not recommended Airbnb, for the following reasons.
1- Usually more expensive than other sites due to high fees.
2- if the host scams you they would probably  side withe host at the expense of the guest since they don't want the hosts to leave the platform. They even delete negative reviews.
3- support personel are unexperienced and hardly speak English."
2024-08-09,1,Airbnb is a scam ,"Airbnb is a scam. 
It is important for all Airbnb guests to be aware that there is no protection in case your host cancel, including at the last minute. In brief it means that Airbnb is only after your money and doesn't care about you, as a customer, if the host decides to cancel (including for basic reasons such as water damages due to leaks, faulty roof etc.). Airbnb's top priority will be to refund you to ensure it no longer has any (legal) liability. They will first insult you by offering a voucher of 20$ for finding an alternative accommodation. In case of last-minute cancellation (within 7 days of stay), they will offer a voucher for up to 50% of the original booking. If you are unlucky, you will not be able to find alternative accommodation at short notice. If you are ""lucky"" to find alternative accommodation, this voucher will not cover the additional cost associated to a last minute booking and you will end up thousands of dollars out of pocket. To the best of my knowledge, no insurance will cover for this situation. It is also worth being aware that Airbnb failed to pro-actively cancelled the existing reservations (including mine) after detecting that the host went rogue. If you'd like peace of mind for your holidays, do not use Airbnb (until the CEO/company culture changes). I would strongly encourage to use Expedia instead, which puts its customers at the heart of its business each time an issue arises. The proof is in the pudding (i.e.  share price) and I would not be surprise to see Airbnb going bankrupt in the near future unless it changes its policy."
2024-08-09,1,Host is trying to scam money out of me…,"Host is trying to scam money out of me and my family for damages and theft we never did. She claiming we broke oven safety glass and stole two towels and a roasting tray with is actually laughable. Airbnb has sided with the host even with zero evidence as they always will because it benefits them financially. Stick with hotels, you're much safer."
2024-08-09,1,Terrible experience,"Never thought hosting at Airbnb induces this much anxiety. The review system is brutal for hosts and for guests alike. It is very much subjective. I will never host or be a guest at Airbnb ever again. It used to be a good place to find places that felt like home, not expensive and not judgmental. Shameful....."
2024-08-09,1,They cancelled my reservations and cancelled my account WHILE I am in one of the flats of their website,"They cancelled my account while I am already staying in a Airbnb host’s flat.

Thanks god the host is not a idiot and let me stay in the flat until the end of the agreement, but who knows what could have happened if the host was less flexible.

I already made another account (you can NOT tell me what to do dear airbnb) but I won’t be using their service anymore. 

Because of politically correctness and woke ideologies they block you from accessing the service while you’re already inside the apartment. 

Absurd. "
2024-08-09,1,Hey Airbnb: IT'S O-V-E-R!,"If you've been loyal to a company for 15 years or so, it's natural to expect loyalty in return. And, in the case of Airbnb, this was the kind of thing you could expect even 10 years ago! However, they make it very clear these days that they're not interested in sustaining your business, they are only interested in enforcing their ""policies"" at any cost to their customer.  I feel great after deleting my entire account, including loads of feedback and reviews that I carefully contributed to their cause – and I just want to warn anyone considering using them to just look at these reviews on this site here. Doesn't it say a lot that there's no customer service outreach to even respond to them? I'm out! BuhBye Airbnb."

The payout Airbnb gave me was peanuts and doesn't even cover the damaged worktop. I'm now left with knife marks on my previously immaculate worktop. It can't even be buffed out due to it being a gloss laminate worktop. Buffing it out would only damage it further. I have been a superhost for 2 years in a row and the service received from Airbnb is appalling. "

AirBNB allowed manipulation by Host, who made up a story to avoid a negative review and cancelled us at 11 pm!  (I guess that avoids review)I was issued a full refund and had pictures to support my account of a parking issue. Yet they still removed my negative review. The host cancelled our reservation After check in and threatened to call the police at 11 pm on 2 elder ladies. No harm to property, party, noise etc.   This is total Review Manipulation and fraud. I would  Not Trust AirBNB or a host, since they hold all the power over you. You can be straneded anywhere!  A hotel is better protection for sure."

I was requested to leave the property in Florida USA for 3 days due to bed bugs (no fault of our own) my daughter was bitten badly. I had to pay out of my own pocket for the temporary accommodation. 14 suitcases and a fridge full of food! No word from Airbnb when our costs would be covered, they do not respond for hours. I called them only to be told the agent dealing would call back, they don’t. They just leave you to deal with it yourself. Utter disgrace. I will NEVER use Airbnb again.

2024-08-08,1,Absolute useless company and support ,"I no longer trust airbnb. They say you can contact their support 24/7 yet it takes hours and hours to get a response. 

I rented a place which was affected by bad weather. On arrival it had no power, no running water, therefore no washing or toilet facilities either. The lack of power meant absolutely no amenities available. Host is completely unhelpful. Contact Airbnb support and they take hours to respond and ultimately try and convince me to stay there rather than going somewhere else. As it is late, too late to go elsewhere, I agree to stay the night despite no power water heating or anything.

As the power and water is still not on the following day I decide to leave. The problem here is you’d think you’d get some support from Airbnb? Nope. Despite not having any amenities not even power or water Airbnb STILL charge you for the night there! They ultimately refund the nights not used but they are zero help when the place is not as described and don’t do anything except the bare minimum. There’s no way they should still charge when nothing is as described, they really owe a refund.

2024-08-08,1,Airbnb - cancelation policy is unsafe,Airbnb has a cancelation process and policy that puts guest in danger. I needed to cancel my reservation due to Hurricane Debby. The path of the hurricane and flood event was in the direct path of the Airbnb in SC. I was told that I could not receive a full refund because they did not have the area listed in the area. I had to beg the host to give me half my money back. I can't understand how a company can put their guest in jeopardy. 
2024-08-07,3,Disappointing customer service,I have stayed over the years in multiple AirBnB apartments and in most cases things have worked out well. Last week we came to our booked property which had a misleading info on the listing which didn’t match the reality (1 less bathroom) + bedrooms with windows facing an underground „patio“ with plastic ceiling- dark and with no fresh oxygen entering. We immediately complained and wanted to move out but as other reviews said: i had to explain and write the issue 7+ times to different people. Resolution came after we had left the property and we got compensated only approx. 20% of the value as a compensation for the discomfort. The policy aircover which is supposed to handle such issues was not mentioned and the host‘s false listing info is still there. 
2024-08-07,1,The property was very dirty and needed…,"The property was very dirty and needed complete repalcement of furniture, shower cabinet, large shutters. And more I let the host know immediately about the problems and let him know I had moved out. At first Airbnb refused to mediate as I had left it more than 72 hours before I notified them. However they did in fact proceed then offered me £45 re cleaning appartment then following my dissatifaction offered £100. Not getting an instant response from me they closed the case."
2024-08-07,1,Worst service ever,"They say the money is protected and their customer service will solve any issues but in reality they don't do anything.

2024-08-07,1,"Air bnb supports violence, assault & illegal behavior, if they can make abuck","Air bnb actively supports hosts who ASAULT their guests and kick them out for no reason other than the host was having a mental health issue. The host nearly broke down our door, threated us with violence  and swore worse than any sailor I've heard. Racist stuff too. 

They removed my review because that's the policy if you are refunded. Disgusting. 

There are others who claim they were threatened with a GUN. Air bnb is NOT safe. These things happen, but, when the company puts their head in the sand and keeps collecting the money, people get hurt. 

Bnb loves these type of hosts. They are desperate, with a record. So they can't find a job. This is their only way to make money and it shows. "
2024-08-06,3,Airbnb Customer Service is terrible,"Airbnb is only getting three stars because of the places I have stayed and their hosts.  Otherwise, their customer support would get a 0.  No matter how many times you call about the SAME issue, they are unable to relay what you have been calling about, so you are forced to reiterate the problem.  Also, they tell you they will call you back and never do!!  So you have to call back and then explain to that person your issue AGAIN.  FIX THIS AIRBNB"

Having dealt with Air b&b directly, they were the most untrained staff I have ever dealt with and absolutely no help. Firstly, they were unable to locate my account for the first 10 minutes due to mistyping my name countless times. Then they proceeded to tell me the bank card which was used for the gift card wasn’t in my name (it was). Then lastly, they had 2 days to cancel the gift card and now I’ve just got an email saying that it has now been opened. I will NEVER use them again.

Very disappointed with the lack of empathy, communication and training their staff members have. The customer service team are very clueless and dismissive. I've been registered as a guest for over 9 years and have had over 9 stays with all positive reviews yet they've placed restrictions on my account and not allowed me to book accommodation due to a potential party. A party i have not stated i will be having?? They've then applied further restrictions on my account and stated certain properties are not available for me to book - when i click the reason it says i need to have 3 or more bookings before i can book said property. How does that even make sense??. I'm done with this platform"
2024-08-05,1,Fake Fake Fake,"Fake Fake Fake! I only wish I had read the reviews on Trust Pilot before booking with this company as oppose to reading what are now clearly fake reviews on their own website. A review of the place we checked into only hours after the previous guest had left and the so called reviewers who wrote “extremely clean and comfortable”. How is that possible when we arrive only a few hours later and following a so called “clean” to find the place discustingly filthy? Yes we took photos and yes we addressed the issues ourselves with the host. However, what’s the point of writing a review on the website of a company that clearly don’t value truthful and balanced reviews of their customers or take them seriously enough to upload them? Absolute charlatans of a company I certainly would not recommend or use again!"
2024-08-05,1,Unfair Damage Claim Resolution,"I have been a loyal Airbnb user for over 10 years, consistently receiving positive reviews from hosts. Recently, I encountered an issue with a property managed by GuestReady (reservation HMTDWW5XMQ). Despite being non-smokers, my partner and I were charged for a burnt mark on the mattress. Additionally, the coffee table was missing upon our arrival and was later replaced, and there were multiple burnt marks on the carpet, suggesting damage by a previous guest.

Despite providing detailed explanations and evidence to Airbnb, they have upheld the decision to charge us. GuestReady has been unresponsive, and this entire experience has been extremely frustrating and unfair.

I urge Airbnb to reconsider their decision and ensure fair treatment of their long-term, loyal customers. This experience has significantly impacted my trust in Airbnb’s resolution process."
2024-08-05,1,I do not recommend Airbnb,"I’ve using Airbnb for several years, but it’s got to the point I can no longer trust the site. They do not have a working complaints procedure and as their advisor stated the UK is no longer part of the EU, so nothing can be escalated. I have had several bad experiences lately, one of which was when we arrived at a property in Florida to find the pool light floating in the water, we reported it the day we arrived with photos, it took eight days for them to repair, Airbnb refunded us €200 dollars for the inconvenience/safety issue and then sent us a invoice for the repair! 
This is not a company I would recommend, they used to be good, but standards have fallen to the point that I would never use them again.

She claimed the fires will be contained, which she can't possibly know, and refused a refund. Once she rebooks, she will then make almost double her income. There apparently is no policy with Airbnb about refunding deposits when acts of nature force you to cancel.
Followup. We contacted Airbnb and they responded admirably. They contacted the owner and she agreed to a 150 refund. Then to our surprise, Airbnb refunded the remainder out of their pocket. Kudos to Airbnb."

2024-08-03,1,Hosts are banned for guest attitudes,"I have been a host for four years. It works and my house is clean and safe. Airbnb compensates cleaning fees and problems. 

The issue is bad reviews. The system gives automatically suspensions and threat ""your article is in danger"". Airbnb refuses to change the automatic suspensions for ""quality and training purposes"". The staff is reachable by chat and phone, but they use phrase language like parrots.

I got bad reviews as a discriminatory act. They are responses from angry guests, who didn't like me telling them to clean. They already left the house and had a nice stay. Airbnb refuses to remove those reviews or the one week of suspension due to having 2 and 3 star reviews. I demand Airbnb to open my house today

I find it unacceptable that the Airbnb review system is about guests telling bad things to other people instead of hosts. We don't have a chance to fix issues. It is slander. Also the fact that not my 4.2 average score but five worst reviews are used to suspend my house. 

Some of my three star reviewers don't mean to scould or get houses suspended. They just don't know how to use the review system. They are surprised for the suspension. I want yes or no reviews, and to call Airbnb to solve real problems, not automatic suspension for attitudes"

2024-08-02,1,Avoid! They let everyone down including the host,"Reciept sent to them in email, this is copy of my email to them
A serious and potentially fatal incident happened to my partner during a stay with Airbnb, a shelf fell on him full of encyclopedias, apparently they can't find the booking details on their systems to deal with our complaint and my partner has been left with serious injuries, the customer service is appalling! A email of complaint has been sent but I don't expect a response, reality is if he had set sofa up as a bed this would of fallen directly on his skull they will be hearing from our solicitor.

It clearly states on there the reservation booking for the house and reservation, appears that the customers that you deal with are not important as it's taken over two hours for me to report a serious accident that happened at one of your premises booked through airbnb and we are still no further forward..

We called airbnb, we spoke to a gentleman called Michael, he was not willing to give us his last name, he stated during that call that we needed the book in reference number and would call us back within 20 minutes  to give us time to obtain that booking number so he could apparently help us further and forward the call to the relevant department,that call never happened.
After obtaining that booking reference number my partner called airbnb back after 40 minutes and we got the same all handler Michael, after going round and round in circles and him stating that the booking reference number wasn't accessible through your systems I then took over the call as my partner was getting more distressed and rightfully so after this ordeal, I asked him why he didn't return the call after 20 minutes as he specified, he claimed that it was down to technical difficulties with the system to the reasons why he could not call us back, it's questionable if he ever intended to call us back, I asked to speak to a manager which he declined to do.
What is concerning that is that the line we went through was pacifically for safety issues.

my partner Daniel was awoken sharply at 2.30/3am by a shelf falling off the wall that held over approximately  30 encyclopedias that fell directly on top of him, fortunately he had fallen asleep watching a film and not pulled out the bed as it was designed, the reality is this could have been fatal as the shelf and the content would have fallen directly onto his skull, during this incident he has seriously obtained serious injuries to his arm and face and is extremely shook up and traumatised, he is currently at the hospital awaiting to be seen by a doctor to check whether the arm is broken, in all the years of our relationship have I even seen that grown man cry like I have today, so based on that it's clear the impact this has had on him physically and mentally.

We have spoken to the owner of the property directly who has been extremely helpful and empathetic to Danny and us as a family, Lizzie was clearly distraught in our conversation on the phone I can't say the same for Airbnb.

I made a last attempt with Airbnb and spoke to a gentleman called mayuresh and the same information was given to him with reguarding to the booking and in incident and the same response was given to the situation, infact we were told to call back Monday when Danny's supervisor would be available to make the call with my husband, what kind of response is that! It is unsure whether Danny will be accessing work for the foreseeable so we are unsure when this information sharing will be happening at this stage. In this situation there should be  a more accessible process, we were unable to log Danny's details due to this, let alone the impact of his injuries, the priority should have been with Danny to get him to an emergency room and is injuries checked not having to go through these difficulties with airbnb,this should be able to be done promptly luckily we have the direct number for the house owner otherwise she too would of had no information reguarding this about her property or the situation reguarding my husband, so she also has been let down too, im sure she pays you to manage her property and any issues that arrise this is also unacceptable across the board not only to her but us too, we have a duty of care to her property to report it to Airbnb and equally as a customer be able to report serious situations like this about your customers which this appalling service have prevented.

I look forward to hearing from you promptly, communication will happen directly to the house owner directly as you have not given us the platform to do this through yourselves.

There's little support to navigate a very complex platform. It's not surprising to hear so many negative stories from travellers. Hosts who want to offer a great product are as much in the dark as their guests.

Responses to requests for help are more often than not 'cut and paste' boiler plate type replied that make no sense unless you're prepared to devote weeks or more of your time to deciphering their jargon and strictures.

This is not a customer focused company. 

Their fees including sales tax are around 20% - Bookingcom offers a much better experience and has a more transparent pricing model for commission. It astonishes me that guests use this platform whilst spending 20% of their accommodation budget supporting a multi billion company.

I really hope the ceo reads these reviews as there is something fundamentally wrong with this company if they can't help us in our situation. We provided 20 photos and a long list of issues as evidence, but they still did nothing. I Challege the CEO to call me on +642188847 to discuss further because your company is in trouble."
2024-07-31,1,Airbnb customer service is HORRENDOUS,"Airbnb customer service is HORRENDOUS. They don't know what they're doing. They say they'll help, but they just copy and paste templates without actually using their brain and trying to sort out the issue. I have been trying to get a SIMPLE issue with calender pricing fixed all week and they just keep going around and around in circles. Totally useless. Airbnb... you're such a huge business, why won't you invest in better training and better customer support? I think I'll remove our two listings. Not worth the hassle."
2024-07-31,1,We had the most horrible week with 2…,"We had the most horrible week with 2 each back to back stays in the north coast of California. First choice was a beautiful home on the coast! The deck had severe structural issues with the railing. I almost fell off the deck when I put my hand on the deck to balance myself. The deck furniture was also unstable as the screws are all rusted out from the salt air. Gave low marks on reviews due to no dressers to unpack into, full freezer and refrigerator….(where would we put or stuff)? 
It was advertised that it had a fire pit. We found the pit full of Styrofoam sheets, plastic bags and other toxic materials. And then getting ready for bed late at night, when I was getting into one of the beds..I fell right through to the floor. It was a slat bed with none attached slats. While down on the floor, I found the mattress was all urine stained. I took pictures and was able to get the owners phone number to text them to. 

He roasted me on the reviews even though I showed him pictures and offered tips how to fix the railing!I reported it all to Airbnb. Took 2 days to deal with them over this place.

 We found another place inland. It was a cozy old place. She asked her to give her 5 stars. She is a “super host”. I did not find anything super about it. It had no AC, had to ask her for fans. Nothing more than a small fry pan and tiny pot for cooking. Toilets were the smallest I have ever seen. Nothing to pack into. No dressers, no space in the restroom for our toiletries. WI-FI was sporadic and unreliable…TV watching via her router…streaming movies would lock up. However, the beds were amazing. So, posted accordingly. 
She posted all kinds of lies about us on her reviews. Like we were loud and obnoxious, arrived “full ourselves bragging  about how we took it to the man over the last place” and how we were “trying to use the system to get a free trip” tough I paid for BOTH homes before AIRBNB deducted part of my first reservation as a credit. (AIRBNB TOOK DAYS).
Got no where with the air bnb staff even after speaking to their safety team about the unsafe deck. The home is still available with no repairs done. 
I emailed the CEO of Airbnb and attached pictures of the issues with the first place. I asked for them to remove the slanderous reviews. Next day I was denied my request. 
Horrible!

Airbnb does not care guests get tricket. And they don't care they help an unreliable company destroy peoples vacations, including ours, as the company did this as soon as the industrial vacation began here in Sweden. The company that are allowed to lie to guests on Airbnb is Novasol/Awaze. I was fined 125% of my monthly income after telling that company they used the wrong settings, that we was on vacation now, that they had to block certain period. They refused to obey and booked another guest, ignored me repeating that we can't have guests (the house was occupied), and instead of owning their error they fined me all my money and more. And to Airbnb that is okay behavior! I will delete all my house on Airbnb and never use them again when travelling, as I don't trust them when they allow this on their plattform. "

My complaint is that the hosts of the homes where I have stayed seem to want to vent about their financial situations and are quick to ask you to move in with them for long term or permanent because they are mostly over living their financial means and see you as a bank to support them rather than a guest in their home. I do not want the pressure of someone begging for money and that's what it is. I suggest people doing AIRBNB to make extra income start using their profits for necessary things instead of throwing away what they make and trying to live in a house that's not in the rich area and trying to keep up with the Joneses next door to impress them because if you are a host spending that money on your week family vacation instead of doing repairs to your house.. that's really not my problem. 
2024-07-30,1,Appalling Customer Support,"I can only reiterate what other people have said in their reviews.  The support for hosts is terrible.  

I have been an Airbnb host for 11 years.  Until about 3 years ago, I was very happy with them.  Recently they are charging more commission and providing appalling service.  

Their support staff are willing but they are clearly totally untrained and unable to deal efficiently with any problems.  

In the last six weeks I have had 3 major issues with Airbnb.  The last is a shortfall in payment to me of nearly €4500.  I have been unable to resolve it with Airbnb but have been fortunate that my guest is honest and we have settled the debt privately.  

It is also incredibly frustrating that the company has no complaints process.  One can give feedback but there is no record of it, and no one replies to it.  They just say a team will work on it."
2024-07-30,1,"Use another platform, poor experience with AirBnB","I came here to write a review and I’m surprised at the amount of low rated, customer reviews there are.

Our host cancelled our accommodation on the day, 5 hours before checking in. We were already in the area, and therefore decided to call AirBnB to support. 

We had booked a 3 bedroom house, as it was for 6 adults. 

AirBnB decided to find ‘similar’ places, an supposed 6 adults to stay in 1-2 bedroom properties. They sent over a few listings which seems to be 1 room with multiple beds. No further help was given from them, just a £20 voucher that I did not want.


- Poor customer service
- Clearly intelligently chosen agents in asian countries paid low, they sound very robotic and no clue how to help
- I won’t be using AirBnB anymore, it’s safer to go through alternative sites like Booking.com or Expedia. "

We called the police who made sure we are safe, until we leave the property with the child and the small dogs. We submitted video of the host attacking us to Airbnb, who seemed to be supporting at the beginning but the next day, they have blocked our account as there was a violence during our stay. We were the victims and we were punished by Airbnb for reporting about the host. I am very disappointed that what me and my family have suffered and that the situation was allowed to stand by Airbnb. They clearly don't care about the safety of the guests. This Airbnb host should never ever be allowed to list his property anywhere. After this situation we found out that this host was blocked by booking . com, so clearly it was not his first time.

The place was disgusting and when I was packing my basket accidentally hit the air conditioner and the cover fell off, let me just say the amount of mold inside that unit was enough to make anyone sick. The lock was broken when we got there, the fridge temp wasn’t consistent, complained everyday, bedding was never changed from the previous guests and the ac was FULL of mold! Never again!!! "

They don't care how dirty and run down a place is (no ventilation in kitchen or bathroom, for example) and don't even get me started about the extra fees they allow hosts to charge outside of the agreed rate.

2024-07-29,1,A Traveler's Nightmare: How Airbnb Failed to Protect Me from Assault,"**Review of Airbnb: A Cautionary Tale of Safety and Accountability**

I am writing this review to share a deeply troubling and horrifying experience I had with Airbnb. As a single woman traveling in a foreign country, I expected a safe and secure stay when I booked through Airbnb. Unfortunately, my experience turned into a nightmare.

During my stay, I was physically attacked by the host. In a state of shock and fear, I immediately reported the incident to Airbnb, believing they would take swift and serious action. I was sorely mistaken. Instead of receiving the support and protection I needed, I was met with a bureaucratic nightmare.

Airbnb initially promised to investigate the incident. However, I was continuously given the runaround, with no real updates or progress. A week later, to my utter disbelief, I received an email stating that my account had been blocked. No further information regarding the assault was provided. This response was not only inadequate but utterly insulting, considering the gravity of the situation.

I am disgusted by Airbnb's treatment of my case and their handling of such a serious incident. It is clear that they prioritize their hosts over the safety and well-being of their guests. As a traveler, you expect the platform you use to take responsibility and ensure your safety, especially in a foreign country where you are most vulnerable.

I strongly urge everyone to avoid using Airbnb for their accommodations. The company's inability to protect its guests and their blatant disregard for the severity of assault is appalling. Safety should always be a top priority, and Airbnb has failed miserably in this regard. Do not put yourself at risk; choose a company that values and safeguards its customers."

2024-07-28,1,Amazing Window View 2Room Apartment by Andel Metro,"DON'T. BOOK.

(The title is the Airbnb so you do not book him)

Me and my 2 closest friends decided to travel to Prague, and need an apartment for 2 nights. We saw Cyril's flat, and since the price was relatively cheap, we booked it, as well as paid for the cleaning fee, beforehand.

From the start, it wasn’t apparent that Cyril was playing a facade, continuously acting super-generous and easy to contact. He dropped by the apartment and helped us sign some immigrant/vacation-papers, he even pointed out that we should feel at home, and we “of course” could use the necessities we needed. More about the apartment in the last paragraph.

The 2 nights pass by, and we message the owner that we’re leaving. And even though we had already paid for the cleaning, we still fixed and made the fixing, easy for him. Including throwing all trash into bins, hanging the towels back, leaving the glasses in the sink, and making sure nothing was out of place.

Fast forward 3 hours, and we receive an additional request of about 4000 CZK (about an 50% extra of the total fee), for “additional cleaning”. He attaches images of a bottle, a sock and glasses being in the sink, and claims 1800 CZK for them being out of place. 1800 CZK. Furthermore, he attaches images of (according to him) one 5-year old sleeping blanket with a green/ turquoise stain and a black mark (that easily goes away in the wash, since blankets should be washed after usage), and claims we are responsible for the stains. We agree on that the black stain might have come from some type of spillage from a drink, so we agree that we could pay, if the stain doesn’t go away in the wash. 

Cyril adds two more images, of normal dirt on two different towels. It must be quite apparent that if there are hanging towels in the bathroom, they will be used? Do we have to pay extra 500 CZK, for towel usage? Especially when, it’s just normal, dirty towels? 

The apartment itself was relatively similar to the pictures and description on the site, but I find it kinda confusing that the silverfish, insects, garbage outside the main door, the odor from the stairwell that goes into the apartment, the lift that almost breaks every time you need to enter the 5th floor, the shadiness of how you gather the keys, the graffiti on all walls when you take the stairs, the windows that needs to be forced open if you want some type of oxygen, the lack of air conditioning, or the disgusting smell that’s coming from the bedroom? He must have forgotten adding it to the description. Thinking back, we are convinced that neither the sheets, towels or anything that needs to be cleaned, has been cleaned before arrival.

If it isn’t clear, this is a risk NOT worth taking.

I'm writing this one because Airbnb deleted my comment on Cyril's account. So if i manage's to save one from experiencing what happened to me, I'm happy. And the reason I'm giving Airbnb 1 star is that they deleted my comment where I complained about my stay and they left his comment filled with lies up on my profile, which will result in complications with my next stay.

Poor customer support on this one, if this happens to you, document everything and if you suspects your host of being shady. Please take a photo of the place before you leave. We did not and we had to pay for that sadly..."

At this point, the best way to find a place to stay is VRBO. Their website is still easy to use.

Whomever changed Airbnb to this mess should be fired immediately. What a total idiot. What's even worse is that no one at Airbnb has caught this monumental blunder."

They dont provide any proof in case of damage claims, they just ask for proof that you didnt make any damage. i have had emails from one department saying i dont have to pay, and then the other department sends an email i do have to pay. Worst customer service in my life. it took me over a month and 15+ calls to resolve a fake damage claim of the host. and in the end, you cant even write a review about the host because the term expired. you send screenshots of proof to you department, and then the other department has 0 knowledge about anything. what a headache. Booking.com is 100% better in their customer service and i will never book on airbnb again and i will shout this story from the top of the highest hill to prevent anyone i know to every book with these people ever again"
2024-07-26,1,Unethical and unregulated,"As a loyal Airbnb customer for over 10 years, my recent experience with Airbnb's handling of a negative review left by a host has been profoundly disappointing and frustrating.

I booked a stay at Night Pastures in West Sussex, where the host provided a non-functional contact number, failed to deliver essential information through the Airbnb platform, and encouraged us to leave reviews on external sites like TripAdvisor. These actions, which violate Airbnb’s own guidelines, led to significant communication difficulties and a very unpleasant stay.

Despite my numerous attempts to resolve these issues through Airbnb support, including providing evidence and clear documentation of the host's violations, my concerns were initially acknowledged, and the negative review left by the host on my profile was removed. However, without a satisfactory explanation, the review was later reinstated.

The host’s negative review criticised me for excessive messaging and late arrival—issues directly caused by the host’s own shortcomings. This retaliatory review unfairly tarnished my reputation, despite the host being at fault. Airbnb's support team initially agreed with my concerns, but then inexplicably reversed their decision, reinstating the unfair review.

This back-and-forth process, filled with misleading assurances and unfulfilled promises, has been extremely frustrating. Airbnb's support team has shown a lack of accountability and regulatory responsibility. Furthermore, their suggestion to respond to the review was redundant, as I had already done so.

The behaviour of both the host and Airbnb in this situation has been unethical, reflecting poorly on Airbnb’s commitment to maintaining a fair and trustworthy review system. It is clear that genuine customer concerns and loyalty are not valued, and this has left me reconsidering my future with Airbnb.

I expected more from a platform that I have trusted for over a decade. This experience has been a stark reminder of the importance of accountability and customer support, both of which Airbnb has severely lacked in this instance.

I hope this review helps others be cautious and highlights the need for Airbnb to revisit its policies and customer service practices to truly support and value its users."

2024-07-26,2,complete waste of time booking anything in advance these days,"used many times over the years but lately it appears that hosts are able to up the prices or cancel the booking with no consequences. The last 3 bookings I have made well in advance have all been cancelled by hosts closer to the date, even after requesting immediately after booking, that the host acknowledges the booking and confirms. This is simply so that host can obtain a higher price for the booking, each of the cancelled listings have immediately been relisted at higher prices and each of the hosts has tried to insist that I cancel the booking myself so they receive no fees. Airbnb help centre is absolutely terrible and offer no resolution. Each time I have had no alternative but to book another option at inflated prices, closer to the date. customers has zero rights and no guarantee of booking even after paying in full"
2024-07-26,1,What a load of bologna on rye bread!!!,"I had to cancel our reservation due to family members not being able to get time off with their jobs. We had gotten a $400 credit and nowhere does it say that we couldn’t use the credit towards the new reservation’s deposit. When going to book I see that the $400 was coming off of the TOTAL amount and not the deposit. I had called Airbnb and got the run around 3 different times. One person said it can’t be used, another time it can be used. Which one is it? It shouldn’t be this hard to use MY MONEY however I please when it comes to booking. Of course Airbnb doesn’t think so. Even if you cancel your account the credit STAYS and isn’t refundable. I’ve used them several times in the past but this made me steer away for sure. They’ve really gone downhill.

2024-07-25,1,My family and I recently attempted to…,"

My family and I recently attempted to book accommodation through Airbnb and found a listing that seemed perfect for us. Fortunately, we didn't pay immediately, as it turns out that recovering our money would have been impossible due to the platform's policies, and we would have lost our money.

Airbnb allows dishonest users to post listings with misleading prices. Had we paid for this booking, we would have been forced to pay extra. I want to emphasize that we filled out the booking form correctly. However, when we contacted the host, he informed us that the listed price was irrelevant and that the actual cost was double. He then suggested we book directly through his own website.

When I reported this to Airbnb, they simply thanked me for the information and sent me guidelines on how to book correctly. I already know the rules, which is why I reported the violation in the first place. It seems Airbnb doesn't care that their site hosts listings that violate their own policies, putting customers at risk. Instead of addressing the issue, they pointed us to their rules, even though the problem lies with Airbnb.

My wife and I used to frequently book through Airbnb, but now we will need to find a new platform. This experience has completely shattered our trust in Airbnb."

Fascinating how they can tell you when you’ve done something wrong but can’t tell you what. A bit hard to address an issue like that 
2024-07-25,1,Insurance not excising …,Overall I find the airBnB a good platform but only if you don’t have any issues. They promise the world with the insurance. I have had two cases both as a host and as a guest and every time they have treated me like a child… and off course with no solution?!?

Emailing Airbnb was a waste of time as nobody had the ability to understand the circumstances."
2024-07-24,1,NEVER USE AIRBNB,"NEVER USE AIRBNB. It is the worse hospitality platform. NEVER TRUST HOSTS especially Borges in Barcelona.
Reservation was confirmed so we went and bought plane tickets(longhaul flights), ferry tickets and hired a car, for the host to just cancel the reservation the next day without any explanation. I still haven't received full airbnb refund and I have no idea where we are staying now and I can't get a refund for any of the flights/ferries and car reserved."
2024-07-24,1,Airbnb don't care about the hosts,I am a host and I am extremely disappointed by Airbnb. Airbnb charged me around £1200 for a non specified issue dated 2022 so 2 years after.

Then a couple of weeks later we received an email asking for additional monies for damaging a bed we slept in. The AirBnB so-called resolution process found us responsible for this damage on the basis of a photo that actually showed that the bed was not installed correctly and had broken at sometime as a result of this. If we had broken the bed it would have been something we would have been aware of it breaking of no matter the actual cause … and this did not happen.

2024-07-24,1,Worst Experience with Rentals. Period. ,"We had a place reserved in Georgia for a vacation. We live in California and were planning to visit family and Tybee. The Crowdstrike IT outage downed so many planes that so many travelers had their plans canceled. Our plans got changed by the Airline at 5am on July 23. The host would not allow us to request a refund for the place after July 22 at 4pm. We got the text about 12hours later that our flights were changed and on top that there were no flights we could take as a back-up. We canceled so many plans and EVERY OTHER BUSINESS from car rentals to hotels all understood the situation and how unique it was and gave us refunds. These also were after the date that generally they would allow a refund, but again after explaining the situation EVERY ONE of the other business agreed this was unique. Joseph our gracious host however replied only twice despite me trying to explain our situation and ask is there anything he could work with us on. Even if he offered 50% refund that would have been a nice gesture. But no he refused and simple wrote to me the cancelation policy each time in a copy and paste method. I filled a formal complaint with Airbnb and they did nothing. They kept saying we can try other routes of obtaining you a refund. I asked what were those routes and each time was given a run around about how we can review those methods if the host refuses. Well he refuses and Airbnb simply said we tried everything. I now realize that anyone who went through what we experienced was unable to review Joseph as you are not allowed to tell others of your experience when this happens. There is no method. Airbnb will protect its hosts over its customers every time. I think we should wake up and use our money to support those individuals worth supporting and those that want to better our communities not those out to make money off of others misfortune. "
2024-07-23,1,Airbnb does not protect hosts OR guests,"Airbnb does not protect hosts.  Had guests that trashed our house, broke multiple rules like having pets and smoking inside, left food, dirty kitchenware, and trash just everywhere and all these things explicitly against the house rules.  While there, the guests refused to answer managements calls and texts about these things . . . because they didn't want to get busted breaking the rules.  

Then they left a nasty review which detailed things that did not happen (actually, a couple of things that literally could not have happened).  Upon investigation of his other hosts, this renter has done the exact same thing at other houses, and several times within in the last year alone:  he breaks rules, smokes, has pets, trashes the house top to bottom, then leaves inaccurate and negative reviews so he can get his money back.   He said in his review that he attempted to contact Airbnb about his ""issue"" but they never returned his calls or messages; Airbnb says they don't have records of this.  And, even though he stated in his review that he stayed much longer than he did (and therefore supposedly was ignored and inconvenienced for a long time) and Airbnb's facts, again, state otherwise, his review is allowed to stand despite obvious lies.

Airbnb says that despite the guest's written history of his exact same continuing BAD behavior, they can't prove he did anything wrong or that his review is inaccurate or inflammatory. Airbnb won't take the many hosts' many words for it.  So the hosts lose their rental money, don't get their deposit for the damages, we personally got our first bad review ever, and Airbnb does nothing to stop this guest from robbing their hosts over and over again.

And like others here, more than once as a guest I arrived at one of their rental properties only to find out the host had canceled last minute, or it was a fraudulent listing, and Airbnb did ZERO.   It is amazing to me how they sided with the hosts then, and this time they are siding with the guest . . .  follow the money "
2024-07-23,1,Customer support is an absolute joke,Customer support is an absolute joke. I locked myself out of the accommodation with no possibility to contact my host and they did nothing to help me out. Just lost of bull****. They called me at 23:00 to see if I managed to enter the property on the phone that was locked inside the flat... For real? I did deal with bad Cs in the past but this is the worst so far. You should be ashamed. 
2024-07-23,1,NO HELP,"We did hounestly described our issues with host in Krakow, ul. Sławkowska 6a/8, in a negative review, supported by multiple pictures. We just wanted to help next airbnb clients. The host retaliated us submitting a fake negative review on us  using legal words like blackmailing. I asked to remove his review as inappropriate and retaliatiated and airnbn refused. Apparently, they worry only about money. Next time I will use booking.com."
2024-07-23,1,Cancelled by Airbnb!,I have been cancelled by Airbnb. Apparently it is because there were inaccuracies in my property listing. I responded that I have never even tried to list a property but they refused to investigate - implicitly branding me a liar
2024-07-23,2,I rented a house in Spain aprox 3…,I rented a house in spain aprox 3 months upfront. Paid all based on AirBnb guideline. I received a Whatsapp message from host 1 day before my trip that the property is canceled. I had to make alot of phonecalls with client support and badically i wad on my own with the host even if I paid airbnb for the service. I was really disappoibted on how they handled the case. I received only a full refund and by that time all proprieties where double in price so the refund was not helping at all as I needed a proprety to stay. That was the reason why I booked months upfront. Disappointed and I will not use again Airbnb platform.
2024-07-23,1,SEXIST REVIEWS ARE OK ACCORDING TO AIRB&B,I contacted airb&b regarding a sexist complaint against a host and  lies regarding the amenities. The host said he had an oven and he didnt and when i said the microwave could do with some instructions i was told HOUSEWIVES SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE A MICROWAVE. I complained to airb&b and they said its ok to leave a comment like that and its ok to lie about having an oven. I feel completely let down and will not be using them again. They are only interested in making money not actually helping anyone
2024-07-23,1,Does not feel safe to book when travelling with small children,"A warning to reconsider when booking airbnbs when travelling with small children. Our family of three, which includes our 3 year-old son, have just had our Airbnb accommodation cancelled 3 days prior to our arrival (we are on a longer road trip). We are now facing accommodation costs far exceeding our original budget (it is double and very much outside our family budget). Airbnb defends their host's right to cancel us, if he sees a better business opportunity with other customers, but does not offer to cover the extra costs we now have to endure as a consequence of this 'freesom'. Instead, they suggest  'booking in a different and cheaper town' or wait another 24-48 hours and see if something cheaper turns up on our destination (so till the day before we arrive with our young son). In short, Airbnb has no interest to take any responsibility for an issue created by one of its hosts, and would rather leave a family with a small child on the street, which has made me feel really unsafe reg. Future bookings.  I have been a loyal customer and host with Airbnb for years, so I am sadened, that this is how their business has developed; from empowerment and accessibility, to corporate and inhumane business."
2024-07-23,1,Charged $60 cleaning fee to ONLY wipe down shampoo,"Host charged $60 for a cleaning fee which Airbnb confirmed was used ONLY for wiping down shampoo in the shower. Host complained that we didn't follow checkout instructions that were at the back of an unmarked folder sitting on the dining table even though we agreed to and followed all rules laid out in the Airbnb listing when we booked, turned off all lights and electronics, left the place tidy, put rubbish neatly inside rubbish bags and closed the bins, washed our dishes, locked the door, put the key back into the lock box and scrambled the code. We should not be subject to negative reviews from our hosts for not following their checkout 'rules' that are arbitrary, not disclosed prior to booking, and can just be chucked into the back of an unmarked folder. It is not our job to do anything further than what we had done which was take adequate care of and respect the property, leave the place tidy, and account for security (i.e. locking up). Outrageous and greedy host which Airbnb did nothing about."
2024-07-22,1,The worst customer support experience ever. I lost my money,"In short: Airbnb blocked my account, cancelled my booking and never returned my money.

I was trying to book a place for me and my friends for our September trip. During the payment I got an error, but everything was alright with my debit card. I contacted support at night. Next morning I saw that my account was blocked but I still could see the messages coming to my account (but I could never reply, error was popping up). 
I got a message that my previous booking (which I had for my solo August trip) is canceled. So I tried to contact support once again but I couldn't as my account was blocked and I couldn't send messages.
After several days I got a message that my account will be removed and I won’t be able to create another one. FOR NO REASON.
My booking was canceled and they are not going to refund me. They sent a page where it's said that if your account is blocked you won't receive any money back. HUGE SCAM!
No one explained me the reason, I didn't break any single rule. I have only positive reviews from hosts and no issues at all. Now they're ignoring me."
2024-07-22,1,Terrible experience,"I reserved a very large house in Washington DC for my son,s upcoming wedding. Reserved in April. Dates were for july 31 to August 5. On July 22 the ""Host"" Marshall of the ""Bloomingdale 4-BR Homestay/Rooftop + Parking"" listing emailed me that his house was no longer available 9 days before the event. I tried to contact him but he stonewalled me on Email. I contacted the company and allegedly he said he thought we were going to have a party in the house. I'm 66, we're bringing the grandkids. There was no mention of a party. The customer service tried to contact him and he stonewalled them too. They said they were going to credit back all charges but that has not happened yet.
Terrible experience, very unprofessional. Would never use them again"
2024-07-22,1,Actually less that a 1 star,"Actually less that a 1 star but I don't get that choice.
Booked a cabin in Pigeon Forge ""Wooded Bliss"" in mid June 2024, paid the requested deposit with travel insurance and received a You're all set confirmation"" email on June 15th.  On July 17th I open my emails to find that my reservation has been cancelled and I was getting a full refund.  I have no idea what is happening.  I look on the site and the cabin is again free for my time frame and the price is roughly $250.00 higher than quoted  and scheduled to me.  I email Airbnb and the Host and one or the other tells me that there was a glitch in the system and the price was quoted to me wrong. LOLOLOL and it took you over a month to figure that out.  I was told that they could not change to rates to accommodate me but they conveniently were able to rate change to benefit themselves.  This absolutely should be illegal to be able treat people like this.  Airbnb customer service HA what a joke. "
2024-07-22,1,Don't care about fraudulent payments ,"I noticed a fraudulent charge on my bank statement for $1900 on my business account from someone booking an airbnb. I always use PayPal to pay for my stays so I knew something was wrong. I contacted airbnb and was told maybe some family members or friends used my card, smh like I really would let someone else hold my one and only business debit card. I asked them to just please cancel the reservation so the money could go back on my card. I was told I couldn't cancel the reservation cause my name wasn't listed on the booking(anyone with common sense can tell this is fraud,my bank card used without my consent and a whole different name and email on the booking). I stayed on the phone with customer service over an hour trying to get them to see that this is fraud. I even sent a screenshot of the charge and confirmation number listed on my bank statement to them. Why not just cancel the reservation and my money go back on my card and the individuals that used my card fraudently wouldn't get a free stay but instead after what suppose to been an thorough investigation all I get is a message stating that maybe a family member or friend used my card. They don't care about fraud and it is not taken seriously.."
2024-07-22,1,Avoid Airbnb it is not a safe platform…,Avoid Airbnb it is not a safe platform at all. I was a superhost for 2 years before I ended up cancelling my account and all booking. I really hope to see this company go bust.

2024-07-21,1,Do not believe the reviews,"Do not believe the reviews. Stayed in Marie’s place in Aix en Provence France. She had 4.8 stars. Pictures of view were untrue. Didn’t mention you had 42 steps in a dirty old hallway with poor lighting. Had a bathroom with a small toilet up 2 high steps that had no rail or room to move. Had damp towels that were worn thin and you only had one towel each to use. No extra linen, pillows and very poor quality bedding. Furniture was so cheap and inexpensive quality that felt it would break if you moved it. Cheap shower gel and no shampoos etc to use. Big issue she had no hairdryer and and when asked she was so damn rude and cheeky about this. Wish I had cancelled and air b&b lie about these reviews.

2024-07-21,1,AirBNB BEWARE,AirBNB is a joke of an orgisation. Would never never deal with this money grabbing company that hide behind texts. Would love to find out who regulates this company ? 
2024-07-21,1,Charged £550 for fraudulent ‘damages’ claim by our host,"We stayed at an AirBnb in Italy (lake Comp) and paid £3,000 for the privilege. On arrival, the accommodation was utterly filthy with mud from shoes in the drawers, hairs everywhere and dust on the surfaces.

We reported this, firstly to the host and then to AirBnB. The host failed to resolve matters (having initially promised to refund our cleaning fee). AirBnB then subsequently failed to take any follow-up action.

In response to our complaint, the host submitted a claim for £550 of ‘damages’, which we are now being pursued for, and which we totally refute.

Needless to say, we will never book with AirBnB again. "
2024-07-21,2,What is Airbnb playing at??,"I like Airbnb but there are some HUGELY irritating features.

This is a new one but it has become annoying very quickly.  I open up a wishlist and up pops a window inviting me to share it - and every single time I move off the wishlist page and then return (or do anything else), I am asked if I want to share the wishlist - I DO NOT WANT TO SHARE THE DAMN WISHLIST, STOP DAMN WELL ASKING ME!!  How many times do I have to click the ""x"" button to close this window down??

Also, if I put in a specific location where I want to search, I get pages and pages of properties which, on the same one page, range from 2 mins walk away to 30 mins drive.  Why not have the first page with the closest properties and then subsequent pages move further away?  Instead, I have to wade through pages and pages of places which are of no interest to me: if this is a marketing ploy, it is a waste of time.  I am NOT going to choose a property just because it turns up on page 1 or 2 of a long list!!"
2024-07-21,1,Worst company in the hospitality industry,"In term of the guest support, airbnb is the worst company in term of the hospitality. My numerous experiences tell me that airbnb outsources support to India therefore the goal is one and only: take every penny from its guests!
Use hotels, booking dot com or other travel sites, at least they will help their guests!"
2024-07-21,1,DISASTROUS is how I describe my…,"DISASTROUS is how I describe my experience. A group of friends booked a 3 bedroom in Queens NY for two nights traveling from Canada.  When we got to the location the apartment was nothing like advertisement, the 3rd room was a space in the living room separated by a bookshelf, the shower curtain was torn and dirty, the bath tub was so messy it had morass growing on it, the entrance mat was caked with dirt and parts of the floor had thick dirt sitting on it.

I called Airbnb and complained, after driving for 9 hours they told me all they could do was refund me my fee paid and $100 coupon to help me to book somewhere else, note this was a Friday evening, they themselves couldn’t find anywhere at last minute offering 3 rooms for the rate I paid plus $100 coupon.  They offered to increase the coupon to $200 when they themselves couldn’t rebook our reservation with any other host and me complaining and fussing with them for at least 3 hours after arrival.

Accepting the $200 coupon and receiving the reimbursement fee would mean we still had to pay $500 USD in order to secure somewhere to sleep.  After going back and forth with customer service support up to 1:30am Saturday morning still no resolution because they decided they cannot assist further.

At 2:30am they cancelled the booked reservation still with no resolution to our accommodation, approximately 7am I called them again to find out how do we move forward, they again offered a $200 coupon this time since they had cancelled the reservation this was to be used towards further booking, I told them I will never be booking with them ever again and they were like “ok but we can’t compensate the $200 no other way.

That was the end, so with all the trouble we went through all was received from Airbnb support was a cancelled reservation and my money returned they didn’t care where we slept, or how we managed throughout the night after trusting booking through these people.

IF YOU DON’T MIND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH NO ASSISTANCE WHEN YOU TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME TOWN/ COUNTRY NO HELP IF YOU GET STRANDED, POSSIBLE FILTHY ACCOMMODATIONS, STRESSFUL NIGHTS BECAUSE OF MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENT AND NO COMPENSATION FOR ALL YOU EXPERIENCE “BOOK WITH AIRBNB”

Recent stay in totally unsafe villa with multitude of maintenance issues, exposed wiring, sharp objects in the bottom of pool, ceilings peeling off. The issues were brushed aside by owner and nothing was done by air bnb after several requests to resolved the matter. Was totally ripped off. 
Will be recommending to all friends and family to avoid using Air bnb at all costs. Can’t not be trusted. "
2024-07-20,5,First stay…,First time staying in an Airbnb- decidedly less expensive than a hotel. Of course there’s no continental breakfast as you’re on your own when it comes to your first meal of the day; but certainly the amenities far exceed your typical hotel room which is generally blasé.
2024-07-20,1,Most overpriced website for what you…,Most overpriced website for what you receive that I've used in a long time. Place I stayed at made me feel unsafe. Does this company review their hosts?
2024-07-20,1,Atrocious customer service with little resolution ,"This nonsense about ‘lead guest’ is ridiculous. Hundreds of companies have admin staff who book rooms for their employees whilst on business.
If there is an issue with the accommodation, then you are forcing the person staying at the bnb to relay the issue to their admin person who is not involved in the stay.
It took you the entire length of the stay - a week - to refund a laughably low percentage of the cost of the stay. We needed the problem solved, not a paltry sum as a placater; £27.75 out of £1110.
Also, stop with the pre-written auto responses. You have a score of 1.3 out of 5 on here of over 13,000 reviews. What does that tell you? If another business comes along and overtakes you with a similar model, don’t be surprised. You should be working hard to get to a score of at least 4 out of 5. Your policies and your quality of customer service needs a serious overhaul."
2024-07-20,1,Airbnb host reviews are false!!,"I booked an apartment in Budapest hungry with Airbnb, the host turned out to be the biggest most arrogant cheap I have ever encountered, The amenities stated in the description included. Toiletries, we had the place booked for 6 day, But the host supplied enough toiletries for about a day and a half. After we ran out of toilet paper the host recommended we go by our own for a 6-day stay. We wrote a truthful review about the place which his photos do not accurately depict the reality of how the place was + we also noted what a terrible host He was, he would water down his soap containers, and when you ran out from using it, he would tell you to go buy your own. Needless to say, Airbnb refused to allow the review, stating it violated their review policy. Which was a lie. They use that excuse to make one of their apartments look good. Airbnb does not protect people like us. They are only it for the money and they will side with a host as long as they can keep making money off of them. Stay away from this company, they're rating system is totally false, factual reviews telling the truth are not allowed to be posted, which should be posted, and they deliberately keep them from being posted so they can continue lining their pockets from innocent victims who book places like this because of the reviews which aren't true!"
2024-07-20,1,NEVER BOOK with AirBnB!  Paid over $2700 for 1 month stayed 1 night,"NEVER AGAIN!!!  Stayed 1 night but paid over $2700 for what was supposed to be for 1 month for a condo in Athens, Alabama. Got partial refund but still paid over $900 for 1 night.  

Horribly unclean bedroom slider and patio that was full of cobwebs and insects that hadn't been cleaned for weeks.  Though the host had told me it had just been cleaned and that happens due to proximity to river. Found out that the maintenance person hadn’t been there for at least 2 weeks.  Pots and pans that were greasy and rusted and sink that was horribly rusted.  

Unsafe due to broken blinds that would not close in the main living area so outsiders could look in on the ground floor .  Master bed hard as a rock.  Couldn’t get hot water in bathtubs.

 Had to wait for over an hour for a maintenance person come over for what the host called an “emergency” to look at blinds and water issue.  

Was told that if I wanted to find someplace else to go ahead.  I did and subsequently cancelled.  When asked for a refund I got a partial but the host insisted on keeping the $250 cleaning deposit.  I fought that with Airbnb and they did end up refunding that.  

So I received a little over $1700 back from the 2700 paid.  Over $900 for 1 night.  I could have stayed at a resort on a beach for a weekend for that!

Cancellation policy says if place is unclean or unsafe a full refund is allowed.  Been fighting that all week.  Not going to happen. 

AirBnB say that my concerns were minor and I should have contacted them before cancelling.  

Host has still refused to refund any more, including what she calls “emergency “ call out.  Emergency?  To have blinds repaired because they won’t close?  Obviously she doesn’t go to the property to check on things prior to guests arrival.  "

2024-07-19,1,Disappointed ,"We have booked accommodation in Cyprus in December 2023 to travel first week of September 2024. This booking was cancelled by airbnb in June. Reason: building management has changed and all of the sudden, it came back on offer with a new higher price. We have just managed to find something in similar condition but of course the price was higher due to less choice, closer to the journey.
Today, 19-7-2024 we just got a message about it cancelled. Reason: (owner) we have moved.
Seriously considering it’s a scam.
I’m now not surprised it’s being valued so low.
I’m disappointed. Will be avoiding airbnb!"

Luckily my husband is a building services consultant so he managed to fix it. It was not his responsibility though, as he was a guest there. The thermostat valve on radiator did not work  in the main  bedroom, so it was uncomfortably hot. We isolated the radiator to cool the room temperature at night. Than we discovered the smoke alarm cover was hanging dangerously on  cables from the ceiling. Later I discovered the late message from the host saying ""Busy period"" 
 and suggesting if there is a problem to "" try ""contact the building manager , but currently he was away. We picked the info numbers from the itinerary and sent 2 emails and left a message on the phone, reporting the issues. No one got back to us during the whole period. It felt very unwelcoming.

2024-07-18,1,Not Recommended - Do Not Trust Them- ABNB is a Scam ,"I agree with a lot of other reviews on here.  Their customer service is horrible and untrustworthy.  They say one thing and then transfer cases to someone else who decides what to do.  

I wrote an honest review for a host and gave the host 1 star and the review was removed.   

ABNB is a scam. Don’t stay in peoples homes. Take this seriously and always stay in a place where you can easily get your money back if you’re unsatisfied and leave. Their rules and policies cater towards the hosts and not guests. Guests are not their priority and are being taken advantage of. I think it is unacceptable that they require hosts to be paid in FULL before a trip without guests having the benefit of seeing a property and its condition. I rented a property in Baltimore, MD a month before a trip and did not see the entire property or the condition of the neighborhood. The property was in mediocre condition and the hosts were not cleaning properly and the home was in a very bad neighborhood. The grass was not mowed. The home was located in a neighborhood with boarded up houses, torn down buildings, trash left on the sidewalk, there was a lot of graffiti on buildings, and there are some homes with the windows blown out. The neighborhood was run down. This property should never have been permitted to be on ABNB. While there, I was harassed by the owner. So, I left the property and notified ABNB that I wanted a refund for the unused portion of my stay. The hosts refused to give me my money back for the remaining two weeks unless she / they could find someone else to rent. ABNB’s are NOT LEASED PROPERTIES and should not be treated as such. It is a mistake to require PAYMENT IN FULL before a guest sees the property. Hosts are able to get away with taking people’s money, treating people poorly, and not maintaining their property. In addition, ABNB charges a fee when you use their service. I don’t like their business model and think that they should require a deposit to rent the home and then payment in full is issued once a guest ends their stay. Don’t use ABNB. Bite the bullet and pay extra to stay in a hotel where you’ll have peace of mind."

2024-07-16,1,"Booked rental year in advance, canceled 10 days prior to trip after charging full cost ","I booked a house for rent through air BNB in August 2023, they proceed to keep my reservation until I paid in full 10 days before my trip that was in July 2024. After receiving my full payment they canceled my stay claiming the house was sold - if the house was for sale upcoming guest should have been notified prior and not 10 days before travel and after payment. Unfortunately there were not additional options in the area and several resorts/hotels were booked up so we are staying 45 minutes further from where as intended and the costs of the hotels double since being so close to our trip. Very disappointing and dissatisfying. Air BNB was not helpful after canceling and provides us option 45+ minutes from our original booking at almost triple the cost. Will not be using air BNB any longer seems they went down hill the last few years. "

Now I am at risk of losing money. The host also did not confirm the change in the booking - they decided on their own and changed everything without confirmation, causing a lot of problems for both me and the host.  "
2024-07-16,1,From super host to vagrant,"On vacation with my wife and child in portugal i used airbnb to book a beautiful apartment for 4 nights ,all went well and then i get a message from them saying the booking had been cancelled as i was a noise risk... even though i was with my wife and son .. the host spoke to them and explained that she had met us and didnt see what the problem was , we had already checked in ..
A further message then was sent explaining that the host was quite within their right to call the authorities to remove us from the property ...

This being said our host was amazing ..
Myself being a super host on their site , well was , as they closed my account down there and then ,
Spoiling our holiday without any thought is sickening .
I called the help centre at great expense in the uk from portugal and was explained it would be looked into , then almost instantly a new message was sent explaining that their decision was being upheld... 

We had already met our host and explained that we too were also hotel owners and also had several properties on the airbnb site as super hosts... and then our host was contacted by airbnb , can you imagine the embaressment caused by this ? Totally spoiling our vacation in portugal...

Ive worked with airbnb for more than a decade , gained super host status and some automated algorythm picks up somethinv and spoils everything,
Never had a problem with hosting or as a tourist using their site before...
Disgusting... absolutely disgusting..."
2024-07-15,1,"A host entered my room , Airbnb didn’t care at all!","My last trip to Barcelona ended with full stress and anxiety.

A host went to my room without my consent, after reporting the situation to Airbnb at first they were concerned about what happened even they offered me refund but I said no! I want your guarantee that my belongings are safe because even my bank account were on tables in the room!

After two phone calls, a lot of discussion guess what! It ended with no explanation and even they declared that the host didn’t break their rules entering my room while I have checked in and left my stuff there!!

They were very unprofessional even closed my thread chat many times, pushing me to be silent. From now on the Barcelona host is open handed to do whatever she wants and it may bring harm to future guests because she saw how Airbnb is careless about me!

I still don’t understand why they were so nice on phone, they were saying if we were you we would be more stressed but after wasting several days they ignored me with no explanation

2024-07-15,1,Censorship by Airbnb,"On June 28, 2024, I had a reservation via Airbnb in Madrid for an advertised “Condo” which in reality was a very uncomfortable attic. At the last minute, I had to add another guest and was charged an extra 35 euros per night (105) but didn’t get anything extra like sheets, blankets, pillows, or anything else except an uncomfortable couch. When Airbnb asked to write a review about the place I did, describing the situation. Days later, Sara, from the company told me that my review was removed because it was biased and retaliatory.  I have to say that I am truly disappointed and feel insulted by the idea that I wrote that kind of review about the host and his deceptive add about the “condo.” The fact that the host asked to pay more for another person is fine, what is unethical is that I didn't receive anything extra. Airbnb is exercising censorship by removing my review and is cheating because other potential clients will not have an objective review of the attic in Madrid and will be victims since Airbnb sides with hosts instead of guests.

Now we try and pay the balance for the holiday and we're told we can't use the £227 credit. Totally appalling company, completely disingenuous in their offer to put things right. Fobbed off by customer services, I've emailed their CEO, but not expecting much. 

Do not use these cynical crooks.

2024-07-13,1,Ask yourself why a company this big offers no way to raise a complaint,"Like many others I had used Airbnb for years without issue. When I turned up at a property that was uninhabitable due to a flood, I only received 3/4 of my refund despite having to check out within an hour of arrival. After much back and forth, and because my credit card issuer has raised a dispute, Airbnb have agreed to refund the final 1/4 of my stay but only if I cancel my dispute first - ha, not likely! What I have found is there is absolutely no way to raise a complaint, a lot of case handlers don’t speak the language of the people they converse with and Airbnb repeatedly close down messages to avoid speaking with you. I can honestly say I will never use them again; there’s no point using them as they offer such little support that I might as well save money and book directly with the hosts. Don’t ever expect Airbnb to help you in an emergency - it took them 48hrs to respond to my urgent requests for help."

Later got a mail which says there is only 1 guest and the house owner ask to ajust this. I already provided the information about the family while booking. When I update the guest information again but then it says I need to pay 210€ on top. This is nothing but cheeting. Never again with Airbnb as they are in my opinion frauds."

I called and explained I have been using them for over 5 years and many same day bookings, never once had any issues. I have never hosted any party in my life and also don't smoke or drink. After their review they still upheld there decision. I don't really care about that as I used a proper app like bookings.com but im furious about how they treated me and wasted my time on calls, all for nothing. I think they have really lost the plot with this new rule. Anyone booking same day is not automatically party host ... how ridiculous!"

Less than 4 weeks until our holiday and apparently company we booked with ‘have technical issues with their reservations’ and no longer can honour our booking. A booking we made well in advance which is part of a long road trip so we are absolutely stuck now. Can’t find something the same price or the same quality. And airbnb now closed our case after failing to find us something suitable and bearing the brunt of extra costs for the inconvenience. Feel absolutely scammed by the host company and airbnb. Lucky we made enquiries (we weren’t getting replies from queries from host) before we set off because we would be stuck out there with nowhere to stay. Funnily enough the dates are still available on VRBO at an inflated cost. Obviously a way for the host company (Belvilla of Oyo) to try making more money. Hugely  disappointing!!!!!!!!!  Airbnb youve totally let yourself down. Please be aware of who you allow to host on your site.

I am following the instructions from the article they sent me which didn’t answer my question and told me to contact support. It has been 3 days and not one person on the support team has provided me any support or answers. Just a major run around and multiple people telling me to do all the same things which I have done and nothing has worked. I am positive that in the history of airbnb guests that this error message has come up for some one else and that there is a solution. It appears to me that I need a much more senior person to help me. Please escalate this matter to the highest level before I loose my accommodations in Athens, Greece. I have 6 more weeks of travel in Europe and I have booked all of my accommodations through Airbnb. Someone needs to make this right and help me. "
2024-07-11,1,Refund of 1650.- still missing after 1 month!,"We booked the Paradiso Incanto in Lugano over AirBNB from Cristian R. / Happy.rentals and encountred these issues:

No working wifi as advertised
Mold and waterdamage in two rooms
Mold in the coffee machine
In gerneral not clean
Bathroom door cloudn't be opened or closed
Strip club in the ground floor

We contacted first the host who didn't care and then AirBnB.

According to AirBnB our case was covered by aircover.
AirBnB told us to take another apartment and they would refund us the money from the original booking.

So we booked something new, but never got our refund!

The support is useless, they just send the same message and close the chat!

Almost 1 month has past and we still didn't receive our 1650!!!

AirBnB claims now for almost 1 month that they can't  carge back the money nor make a bank transaction!

So to be clear: The host took the money, refuses to give it back to AirBnB and AirBnB is now scamming us or what?"
2024-07-10,1,They don't even deserve 1 star. Vile!,"They don't even deserve 1 star. They're absolutely horrendous. And I'm angry at myself for using them. Horrific. Airbnb was a novel business model at the outset: it was a viable alternative to hotels. Now, I think they're just trying to bilk people for as much money as possible before the company goes belly up. It's appalling. I was charged 37% percent tax for a very simple 3-day rental. When I tried to get a detailed explanation of which taxes were being assessed and the respective percentages, I was taken on a wild goose chase by a call center operator in the Philippines. She put together some sloppy calculation with specious tax acronyms that didn't even add up. They simply don't care. Do not use them if you can possibly avoid it. Absolutely rotten. It's just automated thievery at this point--and they've offshored everything, so good luck getting any real help to redress your issues. It's just the usual cloying, fake, faux-obsequious operator trying to ""Thank you, sir"" to death. Pathetic. "

Checking in wasn't nice and smooth. The code did not work to get in the building, I spend a lot of time trying to get a hold of someone, but automatic messages keep coming up.  When a live person answered (host) he provided another code that did not worked either. Finally, some guys coming to the building let me get in but immediately I noticed those young guys looked like substance abusers.  I always heard that Canada is safer than USA but believe me, it is not. Please search yourself the news how ""Canada is The hub for stolen cars""  
It is so disappointing going on vacations willing to spend a few days on a new country, all of a sudden, your car got stolen.  The building is unsafe, there was nobody on the building on vacations or friendly families, it was rather intimidating. When the police arrived, they search for cameras, but they found none. 
Americans need to know that once you drive your car up there, you are target. Please search yourself, 105.000 thousand cars got stolen every year in Canada. You are vulnerable in such corrupted billion-dollar business where your life is at risk with host that are invisible.

I left that place immediately, never again!

I have over £1k stuck with Airbnb as ‘credit’ which I was not aware would happen when I cancelled my stay and had to option of a ‘full refund’. It’s incredibly misleading and apparently there’s nothing which can be done about it. I have requested to cancel my account and have my credit refunded to my bank account but customer service say that the Airbnb policies mean this can’t happen. This is such a dishonest way to run a business. Would not recommend.

We arrive late Friday evening with booking ref and 24/7 emergency phone. firstly we could not find the key box to get the key. The office was closed and also repainted so nothing to say where the key box was situated. Called the 24/7 phone number which promptly went into voicemail. after half an hour on the roadside we managed through a neighbour to fine the office and get into the property. As we were all hungry we dumoed the cases and went out for late dinner. The next two days we were on a tour so did not take a proper look around. I have got an old android phone so unable to get airbnb up on my phone, so I went to Yorkshire cottages and reported the bad conditions to them. There was Mould, Cracked Tiles and broken shower and black dust on all the skirting boards and in the wardrobes. The outside space was approx 6ft by 2ft in the yard not enough room to sit and chill with friends. The towels smelt of dirty dish cloth. one of my guests ended up with 10 flea bites and we didn't even have a dog. I took my complaint to Airbnb and they offered me a paltry amount not even a third of the holiday fee. I am disgusted as they did not take into account the lack of tech in contacting them as Yorkshire cottages told me they were the management and Airbnb was the advertiser, but because we went through Airbnb the buck stops with them."

2024-07-09,1,Libel review allowed by airbnb despite evidence ,Ah I absolutely understand why Airbnb has an average of one star now. We were asked to bring supplementary cash for a cleaner.

We were refunded for the nightly rate, but per Airbnb policy taxes and fees are not refundable. In this case that means we paid $228 taxes plus $176 service fee ($404 total) for a stay that cost $276, so 146% taxes and fees. This is unreasonable - we will not be using Airbnb in the future."

Airbnb only gave us a 25 euro voucher as compensation. Terrible service, it takes 12 hours to respond to a chat message. This makes me very weary of using their platform again. Think twice before booking a place that seems affordable. It might end up costing you a fortune if you book through airbnb and the hostel cancels.

An airline flight was cancelled, we contacted them due to a change of the flight, which had nothing to do with us. It was something that was told to us by the airline the day before the flight, and around 1-2 days before our arrival to the Airbnb was scheduled. We contacted them immediately, I spent 5 hours on the phone with them explaining to them the problem, the service team had no idea what they were talking about. Afterwards I had to tell them we had the right to cancel, since Airbnb supposedly had a cancellation policy in these circumstances. Then they told us they would only contact us through the app and not through email, sketchy business, and not only this, but they told us to also not cancel the booking since they would do it on their end and no charges would be made. Airbnb took 3 days to get back to us and they ended up saying they decided not to cover us, and didnt give any real reason, they didnt even want to comment on the so called policy they have in their terms of service. We ended up losing all the money, and the full 400 Euros were lost.

WE ARE NEVER USING THIS SCAM OF AN APP AGAIN! "
2024-07-08,1,"Airbnb fails to assist victims….,again","Airbnb host deception is rampant.  We booked an Airbnb in Forrestville, California. The host accepted our funds and contract THEN the day before we were to arrive the host booked another tenant in the space we paid for and demanded we pay her an additional  $200 to stay in her other space which she was an upstairs “3 bedroom with a sauna and yard”.  When our son in law arrived to stay because he had to eat and be up at 5:00 am in preparation for work, the upstairs 3 bedroom was a hot mess, didn’t have a mattress in the 3rd bedroom, did not have the outdoor furniture shown in the and photos, and did not have a sauna she claimed it had to deceptively pressure us at the last minute into paying her more for a 3 bedroom with a sauna we had not agreed to rent let alone pay her more to do so.  Hosts get by with this deceptive and illegal behavior because Airbnb fails to honor its guarantees. Airbnb uses overseas call centers with people who are unable to help or speak English clearly who are trained to say we will help andwill call back in 15 minutes while leaving travelers in danger. "
2024-07-07,1,Not remotely surprised to see 1*reviews,"Not remotely surprised to see Air bnb has 1 star review. They allow hosts to post libellous reviews about guests who dare to mention that they are unhappy with, for example, building works causing noise and disruption at a location promoted as an idyllic country getaway. Very poor customer service. And poor resolution to concerns that are voiced. Unacceptable to allow hosts to post negative reviews regarding people that they called ‘very pleasant’ and ‘left the place immaculate’ when they pretended to be accommodating to concerns whilst we were in residence.

2024-07-06,1,Nightmare Casa Via Mi,"Nightmare Casa Via Mi, Genova

After a 12 hour flight to Nice, renting a car and driving to Genova for our first AirBnB stay in Italy, we found ourselves within blocks of the apartment. However, the host would only text us the same information again and again. We already had written directions from him as well as from our GPS, but these didn’t help. Both of these directions kept taking us to places 2 or 3 blocks from the actual apartment.
We were to arrive at 7:00PM but by 9:00 we found the building and parked in the back of the apartment so I wouldn’t have to drag suitcases blocks from where we parked.  We texted them that we were outside and would like some help with the bags.  The room was on the 5th floor, which was never posted in the description, nor did it mention that they were on the corner of a busy street that had no available parking.  At 10:00 we called Air BnB and one agent said she would call them and explain that we needed help.  We never heard back from Airbnb or the host.  We called again and another agent told us the same, “I will call him and call you back. It was now 12:00 midnight and didn’t hear back from either agent or the host so I drove off to find a hotel. It was then we received a call from the second agent telling us that they canceled our reservation.  Please note that the host/Airbnb cancelled us, we did not ask for a cancellation. We were told that our payment for 2 nights would NOT be reimbursed. However, the Airbnb agent communicated that AirBnB would reimburse us for the hotel up to the price of the previous room. We have yet to hear from them. Up until the time we arrived, we texted back and forth with the host. The host told Airbnb that he didn’t get our texts and didn’t know that we had a problem! Obviously this was not true because the host responded to our texts with the same question, “Where are you?” When using Airbnb communication is so important, yet the host refused to call us and would not give us a number to call him. I am on heart and G/I medication and spent two days in the hotel room in bed trying to recover from this needless ordeal.
I have used Airbnb throughout the years and have never experienced such an exceptional lack of customer service from a host or Airbnb; nor will I ever use the website again.

2024-07-06,1,Disappointed ,"We paid in full on booking our holiday for our 3 children and my parents. The process was straightforward and our host was polite and welcoming. She is Lindsay and our holiday was in Dorset.

Then less than a month before departure they cancel with no communication or explanation. It’s hard coping with that when not even an apology is given with the news. 

Never again will I use air BnB based on this awful experience. Their customer service is useless. Automated messages at every turn. 

We just can’t find anything available for equal value in the area we’d chosen. 

Please be very very careful using this company I’d hate to see anyone facing what we did. "

2024-07-05,1,If I could give 1 star I would,"If I could give 1 star I would. A guest arrived at my house 2 and a half months prior to check in just to say hello. He arrived unannounced and came to my ring doorbell. When I contacted Airbnb to ask them to speak to the guest to see why he was there they instead called him and told him to leave the property immediately. This isn’t what I asked for. They then told him I wanted to cancel the booking which isn’t what I asked for. When I called and spoke to them they 1. Couldn’t understand me 2. Didn’t give me any real answers just a formulated script 3. Told me that despite feeling uncomfortable with this guest because he hadn’t actually broken into the property I couldn’t cancel the booking without a penalty so I am obliged to accept this strange man arriving nearly 2.5 months early at my home unannounced. This company yet again never fails to amaze me. I’ve had previous issues with them when a guest smoked in my home, let my house cats out, left the front door to my house wide open and then admitted she was involved in the Birmingham bonbings yes they refused to tell her to leave. I should have iknown back then that they have absolutely no interest in host safety. "
2024-07-05,1,Never ever will use it again,"Never ever will use it. 
no due diligence on hosts whatsoever. We got scamed over our family trip to London(my 4 children were dreaming about their first trip to Europe). 
When I as trying to reach and file the complaint just to make sure no one else is suffering same and get help to find the scamer I was told they can do nothing. I was promised a call from senior manager who can help with filing the report and looking up the person  but never got one back.
If I only could scream to the world  so no one ever use this service as they do not evolve as company and never care of either side of equation (host or guest) it is all for getting their fees.  
 Do not expect any help or empathy  from this company. 
There are other companies to look at but I'm not advertising any  here.  Just look it up

2024-07-05,1,AirBnB Has Lost Their Way,"AirBnB has nothing to offer the average guest, the company is just out to make a quick buck for themselves and the so called hosts who in many cases are just landlords with no idea how to provide a service. Their business model is setup to exploit guests who don't realize they have better options elsewhere. AirBnB wasn't always like this as a quick read of old reviews will show, they have gradually gone downhill over the years, every stay now appears more and more like a borderline scam. In recent years each AirBnB booking we've had as a family always becomes a more aggravating experience that puts a significant dent in our plans and causes us never ending inconvenience, much more trouble than just going with a basic hotel. The value to the customer is just not there any more. The customer should be the guest not the so-called host. Finally, the negative feedback I have tried providing on the platform doesn't seem to get through to anyone, they are either pushed out of public view or demoted in the listing results, a shady practice to say the least.

AirBnB has lost their guest-centric focus. I will never book a property on their platform again."
2024-07-05,1,Absolutely terrible they are all for…,"Absolutely terrible they are all for hosts even their community forums there isn't even a tap relating to guests and without guests there would be no hosts! I have terrible experience of a host leaving a bad review.

We were there 3days but up early and gone doing activities only back late at night. The hosts had ample opportunities to approach us or express concern and never did and in fact could have easily done so and I would have happily obliged but it is very unfair that people can literally slander people on this, like this is a huge company and very little can do.

They stated we smoked in the chalet and we didn't anytime I smoked was outside of it never left a mess, cleaned up butts and I hike so I'm very serious about that and leaving no trace in fact during my stay I even brought little lunch bags to dispose of them in public bins in village. They had to fix the shower switch was faulty stopped midway of my shower I had to wait until next late evening to wash my hair but I caused no fuss about it whatsoever  and never even mentioned it in my review I actually gave them a glowing one and when leaving the other guest next door kept giving us dirty looks as she walked ahead to the village but our chalets weren't joined and there was sperating partition between two chalets. The hosts never reached out only time I heard of their unhappiness was the untrue reviews. I left the place spotless and even lit scented candles left windows open I did all that without smoking in it I treated it like a hotel and went outside. It's absolutely outrageous that people can get away with slanderous reviews especially if they never even reached out to a guest or approached them, easily could they live next door to it. I mean surely that would be professional or if they had concerns they'd approach guest and let them know smoking wasn't permitted outside either only rules for inside, and sign inside but nothing about outside and they even had a shell that pubs were using as ashtrays outside on the table however I never used it. It's my first experience with air bnb and I'm extremely put off. I met the husband but never the wife and yet it was her that left slandering review. They never communicated about it or asked me anything, nothing whatsoever! Would they complain if I cooked in it? I'm part of a content creator club and I really wouldnt be recommend air bnb's to the club and there's about 300 of us girls in the club.

extremely unprofessional to go about it way. To be quite honest if they're hosting years you'd think they'd be adabt in communicating with people fact I didn't make slightest fuss about the shower should have shown they could easily approached simply said if I could smoke at the gate wouldn't been an issue. They put signs no smoking inside nothing about it outside. 

Prior to leaving I even got a text instructions to leaving and even stated many thanks and hope I enjoyed my stay. To be honest I met and dealt with the husband but was wife left horrible review.

Contacted air bnb several times extremely unhelpful!!! Asked to speak to management nothing! First experience its awful and never use the site again! Another person I know also experienced the same unfortunately I didn't do my research prior. With a company as large and dealing with people you would think their policies would be a lot better, more professional and so on but no the worst! Surprised they're still operating not sued out of business!! "
2024-07-05,1,Instead of help I got blocked account,"I had an issue with payments—somehow, I wasn't able to place a booking through Apple Pay, PayPal, or adding my credit card details.
I contacted support and thought they could fix it within a few hours.
We talked multiple times by phone, and I sent screenshots, shared the screen, and provided all the needed info as much as I could. I waited three days, and they just blocked my account without any explanation! Great job!

Almost all customer support replies were with sooo huuuuge delays from 4 to 24 hours. 
On the 3rd day of discussions, they said they don't provide service in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, Ukraine. But… I'm not from these regions!
I asked to call me, they agreed to call me back within 1 hour, but instead, they again wasn't calling or replying, and in 22 hours replied that my account will be blocked!
I strongly don't recommend using this service!"

We booked a lodge in Northumberland, this lodge was hosted by Wendy of Hemera Holidays, (who despite this not being her fault she could not have been more helpful and apologetic - praise where praise is due) However somehow another family were allowed into the lodge until the Saturday, we had booked and paid for Friday to Friday!  Bad and very stressful that this can happen and you get a phone call just as you are heading out on your holiday!!!  Spoiled our first 2 days and my husbands birthday with all the stress and having to move next day! "

They also want a copy of your passport AND that you install the app to send them video proof of who you are, in order to be matched with the passport..

I've been with them for years, managing three high-end rentals, earning them loads of money, but dealing with them is a nightmare. Getting any common sense answers is impossible. Their Superhost criteria are a shambles, their security is non-existent, and they never, ever give the host any support. It's all about making money for them. 

I'm sick of the empty, automated replies. It's impossible to get anyone with any authority or common sense to sort anything out. All you get is ""computer says no"" and automated answers. I am so very dissatisfied."

I am totally appalled at their threats. What disgraceful behaviour. What a terrible way to conduct a business. I will be coming off this platform as I do not like being threatened. "
2024-07-03,1,Host Scammed us with False listing claims,"We rented an air bnb in Sevierville TN through host dan kiv who scammed us with his inaccurate false and misleading property description. The home was dirty, unkept, description photos did not match actual property. the host listed property as new rustic cabin with mountain view-all lies. Air bnb refused to help. they constantly closed my case each time I tried to send a complaint. Host has listed this same property several times to up his ratings and hide negative but true reviews. "
2024-07-03,1,Horrible unorganized customer service,"The Airbnb service system has served us poorly. Our host cancelled last minute (3 days before we were due to check in). We were a family relocating and using an Airbnb to stay in temporarily until our new house was ready to move in to. I had found a listings for a place that would have space for all of us and take our pets that we were traveling with. 

Our host stated that he cancelled because Airbnb failed to pay them. According to the email we had until the original day of check in to use our “credit” which was the money we had already payed. To give them credit Airbnb called us immediately and offered to help find us a new host. The “ambassador” promised to follow through with contacting the new host we selected and get back to me ASAP (It is 5 days later and I still haven’t heard from that person).

When I didn't hear back I contacted them again. The next ambassador promised me a 20% off coupon credited to my account. The next 3 people promised me the same and I also never heard from them again. I was contacting them about every 4-6 hours since we were driving cross country and the deadline to get a new place was quickly approaching. I tried emailing or messaging the previous ambassadors with no results. In one case I was cut off and when I called again they told me my original ambassador would get back to me. In another they told me that the 20% of would take 24 hours to get approved. No one could give me a reference number or look at notes from previous ambassadors. In addition my 20% was always a different $$ amount. 

It felt like they were delaying until our time ran out to use the credit and that is exactly what happened. The process was very stressful and difficult. Their version of service is to talk to you reassuringly and then never follow through. Finally I called and asked for a refund since my credit was expiring. The agent told me it would take him several hours to process and that he would get back to me. Given my previous experience I refused to accept this and tried to stay on the line while he processed it. He would not do that and promised to call me back in 20 minutes. His callback did come within the 20 minutes and we are getting our refund but not until 8 days later. 

A friend also told me he had dealt with several last minute cancelations while traveling abroad. Needless to say we will not be using Airbnb again. 

The biggest thing they could improve is keeping notes and reference numbers as well as assigning one ""ambassador"" to each case who would actually follow through and stay in touch.  They could also honor their word with the 20% off coupon which has never materialized.  They have continued to contact me but no one knows the history or can help at this point.

2024-07-03,1,Unreliable bookings and abysmal support,"Absolutely abysmal support. They take several hours to respond to messages and flat out lie about applying rebooking credits to your account when hosts cancel at the last minute, which happens a lot because hosts are aware they can hike their prices when demand is high and Airbnb's host rules fail to prevent it. Any holiday involving an Airbnb booking hangs by a thread."
2024-07-03,1,Airbnb service and company is the worse…,"Airbnb service and company is the worse company in the world.
None of the call people understand what you explain to them, they keep repeating the same thing over and over and lie about what they would do. 
They stole $3,500 as I made a reservation for the place and they cancelled. It was their cancellation. 
The informed me that the refund was issued and it has been more than 2 weeks and I have not received the money. They are saying they don't know where the money is and it is not their problem. 
They are dangerous and I would advise to stay far far  away from them  and not to book. "
2024-07-03,1,My daughter is getting married in June…,"My daughter is getting married in June 2025 and we both tried to book a home in Yuba Juba for the wedding party which consists of 13 guests.  Our request was immediately denied as being a potential party.  I contact AirBNB for assistance and received no help.  While I understand that the potential for parties exist, it could be the same if it were 1, 2 or 13 guest.  To automatically assume is discriminatory in my opinion. I have used AirBNB in the past but will now reconsider before doing so again.  I would not recommend anyone with a large party to use AirBNB.  Thnakfully, I was able to reserve the same house on VRBO and it was cheaper too.  "
2024-07-02,1,Airbnb customer service is dead end,"Airbnb customer service does not listen. We rented an  airbnb for 3 months while our house was being repaired. The host was inexperienced (first rental) who neglected to charge adequate cleaning ($250 for 3 months). Had they charged more, we could have had insurance pay. Instead they tried to charge us a month after check out (the moment the review period expired). We have over 90 photos of checkout condition as we are experienced airbnb travelers but airbnb will not review them. We spent over $100k this past year with airbnb, but this one experience for $500 has soured us. We have never had a complaint before but assumed if anything ever happened it would be easily defended. We are very disappointed in airbnb. "
2024-07-02,1,Really bad customer service.,Really bad customer service.
2024-07-02,1,Air BnB stole my money on the technicality of calling it a 'coupon',"Air BnB had a 'coupon', which is a credit, on my account of £235 for me to spend within 12 months.
I made a booking for £95 and chose to use some of my 'coupon'.
The Air BnB system took the whole £235.
When I challenged this I was told that this is 'policy' that if you use a 'coupon' you use the whole amount, no matter what the balance.
And so they are expecting me to write-off almost £140 because they don't give change against a 'coupon'.
That is, quite literally, theft of my money.
I will not accept this and will, if necessary, pursue legal action.
I have demanded escalation to a senior person at Air BnB.
Are they so desperate they have to steal money that isn't theirs?"

First time using the platform and it is safe to say that it would be my last. I rather sit at home until I die. 

Disgusting listings, awful, useless people (customer service)

Airbnb is what Facebook marketplace is to the Internet: USELESS

Looking to take legal actions against the host and Airbnb. 

They owe me £800 and not replying and passing me around.

Airbnb should never allowed Peter to accept a booking for 6 Adults.

2024-06-30,4,Great Customer Support After Host Cancelled,"This is purely about Air BnB customer support after a host cancelled our accommodation on the day due to an ‘emergency.’ The agents who assisted me were very good, guiding me through the process and sending recommendations for ‘nearby’ properties (one of who would get a 1* for advertising a price then during booking finding a 72% add-on for a cleaning charge for one night for three people.) The refund to my credit card also went through on the same day. However, I’m unlikely to use them again, however, purely because a hotel would be forced to find you alternative accommodation. "
2024-06-30,1,"Horrible, insulting and condescending ","Horrible, Horrible experience and not the first time but it will the last one. 
The hosts have so many rules that it is getting ridiculous, you now book on airbnb and pay for cleaning, pay for the room and pay airbnb and are still required to clean plus you get no services, no refills, nothing during your stay not even fresh sheets for a long stay. To make matters worse if the place is not up to standard (most of the are not anymore) airbnb will basically leave you stranded no matter the time. Now you cannot even call them on the app or chat with them, you have to wait hours for a response. So is either lose your payment and move or stay at a place with cockroaches, mould, no water and basically whatever the host feels they don't want to give you, they just tell you ""it has never happened before, just started now"". We have heard the same phrases from multiple places, along with ""we just bought a new one, it is coming"", ""we just called the repair man, but he is not available"", etc etc. As airbnb doesn't check anything anymore, the hosts are available to do anything they want without consequences. Guests are forced to put either no review or a good review because if as a guest your received reviews get bad you may not be able to book other places on the portal and if you cancel a booking because of a big issue you cannot put a review. As of today, airbnb now allows hosts to bill you deposits or any other payment they feel like outside of airbnb and airbnb even confirms with you that you have to give out your credit card details if the host wants it. The cherry on the cake was being told by an airbnb representative that if anything happens to us at the property or with our payment then ""he will be heartbroken"" but tough luck if you get murdered, assaulted or robbed. At least airbnb people will all be heartbroken for you."

2024-06-29,1,Bait and switch,"I’ve noticed over the years, that the platform has allowed hosts to embellish and, at times, falsely advertise the stays. Hosts have very loose terms for condo, apartment, bungalow, etc. I’ve also noticed that “entire place” is no longer a selectable option, and when it was an option, some, if not most, were any thing but an entire place. I’ve gotten to the point where AirBnb’s are no longer my first option when looking for a stay. Being truthful in advertising will go a long way. "

There wasn't one, and as it was on the 18th floor of a tower block with no fire exit and residents were chain smoking in the corridors, I did not feel safe enough to stay there. I complained to Airbnb and they sided with the owner so I stayed in a hotel and lost so much money."
2024-06-28,1,Everything is wrong with Airbnb,"From my 13 months of hosting on their platform. Airbnb has no regard for their hosts who put in their hard earned resources to create the properties that the Company (Airbnb) uses to make money for themselves. They don't help hosts when they need assistance, if you file a claim for damages or extra services - the host will get a run-around and their Ambassadors will continue to frustrate your claims until you are worn-out and give up.

I had a guest who booked for 4 people, then brought 8 people and a dog that isn't even allowed on the property. I had to cancel the reservation and 18 days later and over 37 calls to Airbnb (Garbage Customer Service Ambassadors) - there's still no resolution but senseless delays, avoidance of communication and unwillingness on their part to resolve the claim and settle accordingly.  

It's just a matter of time until this company FALLS like ""ROME"" knowing that crooked business practices will not last forever and UTMOST LACK OF RESPECT AND COURTESY for the ENGINES that prints your currency will lead to an eventual downfall of this organization - history always repeats itself especially for those who play deaf ears to it."
2024-06-28,1,Terrible Customer Support,They kept declining my booking claiming I’m a party risk when I was simply booking for two adults.

 A host had instantly booked with me. I then informed him about the presence of my dog ( in the listed photos and mentioned in my listing).
Guest then sent as follows.
""Thank you now, and thank you for telling me about the dog. I am not a friend of dogs, and I have a fear of it and I do not want to play or look at the dog.""
This concerned me, ( my safety, guest and dog's)  however after more than one hour  of begging and repetition on the phone Airbnb would not allow me to cancel with out penalty of 25 %.
I did not know the rule had changed concerning the allowance of 3 penalty free cancellation per year if instant book is on.
I have now had to turn off instant book.  Proably an inconvenience for me and teh would be guest.
I am quite disgusted at such an oblivious approach and total disregard of common sense.
Subsequently and only because of the guest's agreement the reservation was cancelled without penalty.
This is not the first time that Airbnb have been unable or unwilling to resolve an obvious issue in the correct way. Similarly they are trying to avoid paying a host referral fee. When you try to escalate these matters Airbnb's first, second and third reaction is to block an d frustrate and repeat what has already been advised. I have then emailed  Brian Chesky which obtains a very slightly improved response, but marginal. I will now look for an alternative platform."

And then when a host gave me a bad review because I didn’t clean the back door.. and the comforter had a stain on it( I didn’t even use the comforter) they wouldn’t take the review off.

This was a blatant lie as we have family over there who arrived at the house to find another family living there for more than 2 months with no sign of them leaving anytime soon. 
AirB&B offered no support at all leaving us to find alternative accommodation on the evening we arrived. We told them we needed a 5 bedroom house as we were travelling with 9 people including a 2 year old child. 
They kept offering us 3 bedroom houses that would not accommodate us for extortionate prices. Eventually, again with no help from AirB&B we had to book 3 separate houses to accommodate us for our 2 week stay costing us over £800 more than expected.
After many phone calls, messages and emails back and forth with AirB&B they said there was nothing they could do for us. After coming home from the holiday we have tried and tried again with AirB&B to try and get some compensation, with them orignally telling us they cant offer us anything as our stay with them had officially ended (not once did they mention this while we were complaining in America). 
After a bit more back and forth they reluctantly offered us £250 back which we have refused as we are holding out for all of our money back, however this was only after we threatened legal action against them. 
We also tried to submit a review on the host that caused us all the hassle however AirB&B removed this saying it didnt meet their review guidelines as we did not actually stay in the house (we never had the option to stay even if we wanted to). 
As of today we are still in communication with them trying to get reasonable compensation for all the stress and hassle. 
The most astonishing thing about this is the original house that we booked is still on the AirB&B website letting other customers like ourselves book it with them knowing fine rightly there is another family staying in it. Crazy!

2024-06-24,1,3 times my booking has been cancelled…,3 times my booking has been cancelled prior to my stay leaving me and my family in the lurch.  AirBnB have offered a voucher as compensation but as it is so close to requiring accommodation the cheapest available is almost double the previous cost and the difference more than 20 times the offer value.  They will be my last choice in the future as they are so unreliable.
2024-06-24,1,Terrible company,"Terrible company. I tried to booked an accommodation for one night and two different hosts rejected my request with the excuse that the room was not available. It resulted to 200 euros on my bank account blocked for 5 days, because the company is getting an authorization void before you even get a confirmation that the accommodation is available…"
2024-06-24,1,Corporate Greed ,"a full 14 days after the guests checked in and 5 full days after they left before they paid me 
i have taken off my ad with them. They had their cash three months ago 
corporate greed i'll be staying clear of this company "
2024-06-24,1,Horrible support,"Horrible support, they will not let me post an honest dislike post about the host and my very bad experience but let the host review my post and post something on my page. Stay away from these psychopath hosts on Airbnb!"
2024-06-24,1,Horrible overpriced site ,"Horrible place. Do not go to Airbnb. There customer services is terrible. They are charging extreme services fees. There refund policy is not promoted and just changed ( in (March '24) and they did not tell anyone. 

They are overpriced. And now they are screwing over the hosts. I filed a complaint and never heard back from them. There services fees have gone way over.

If you are tired. I would urge you to file a complaints with CFPB. what they are doing is unethical and most likely breaking state and federal laws. 

I smell a Class Action Lawsuit like Ticketmaster.

Airbnb was started so you did not have to pay these crazy high services fees. They have become what they said they were starting the business for.

Go to Vrbo.com or booking.com

Much better."
2024-06-23,1,"High service fee, but no help","I have rented a room in a shared apartment for a long time, another guest rents another room, and due to a disagreement about a cockroach problem the landlord was fixing, the other guest chooses to smash a window in the house because I said we should try not to overreact. and that guest threatens me with it  broken window and a fist towards my face, landlord suggests we don't talk to each other, the other guest holds me almost hostage in the room, and of course it's not Airbnb's fault, but it's that their chatbot is useless, their phone number doesn't work, and is never changed to a  person from customer service.  when you pay over 150€ in service fee to Airbnb and can absolutely get no service and thereby not use their Airhelp.

The police will not due anything because they place it on the landlord, and now I'm forced to pay monthly rent via Airbnb for being in a unfriendly environment."
2024-06-23,1,They are so bad- We will never use them…,They are so bad- We will never use them again. We lost a guitar and a lot of other things when we rented it out though airbnb and they did not care at all- We will never use them again - They do NOT have any insurance - They just say they do ! They are so big that they do not care what ever you say. Also we get answers from robot's. or call centers in India . They could not care less- So finish with airbnb. For our 4 apartments -
2024-06-22,1,Horrific experience and will never rent…,"Horrific experience and will never rent from Airbnb again. The hosts house had a pest issue and there were bugs all over the house including crawling in my toiletries, clothes, etc.  We just completed a major relocation across the country and had a myriad of stressful issues to contend with due to the pests.  Needed to find another rental within a few days, hire movers, and repack all of our belongings in order to get into another place.  To top it off, I have 3 air cleaners that I brought into the house from my old house and each had new filters.  Within ONE WEEK, the filters were used up (i.e., completely filled with dirt and BUGS!!!).  It was disgusting!  Not only did she have pest (BUG) issue but her house was filthy.  I realized after a few days of the horror with the bugs that you could barely see out of her windows.  They were filthy with spider webs in all corners.  We are done with Airbnb. "
2024-06-22,1,The worst company I ever dealt with,"I booked a place for a week. I paid first class plane tickets to get there that cost me $1800. I bought a rental and next thing you know I go onto my profile and they lock me out. This is so unacceptable. I have thousands involved I had the whole trip planned out, they told me it would be under review for 24 hours. It’s been over six days. Do not use them. I’m warning you. They literally locked my account after I made all my plans and booked my place now. I gotta figure out a whole new plan."
2024-06-21,5,Great service from airbnb,"Dear Airbnb Team,

As the proud owner of a property in Tenerife listed on your platform, I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation. Throughout 2023/24, Airbnb has been instrumental in connecting me with wonderful guests and facilitating bookings that have contributed significantly to my business.

Your user-friendly interface, efficient communication tools, and reliable support have made managing my listings a breeze. The exposure my property has received through Airbnb has been invaluable, and I eagerly anticipate receiving bookings for 2025.

Thank you for being an essential part of my success as a host. I look forward to another year of positive experiences and fruitful collaborations.

Warm regards,
Tim & Lisa"
2024-06-21,1,Don’t ever book through this site,"Don’t ever book through this site, Iv had £274 taken out of my account without booking anything and the customer service in finding out where that money gone they have bounced it back to me saying you just booked something when nothing has been booked they can’t relate any reference number from transaction and no bnb has been booked basically taken money out of my account from having my details stored somewhere from having booked something years ago. No money back just basically deal with it I’d advise you not to use this site as it could come back years down the line keep watching your bank statements a company like this should not be giving these types of excuses. Stay away!!!"
2024-06-21,1,I have paid a damage deposit through…," I have paid a damage deposit through your resolution centre by card before a trip to Portugal. The host has refunded this but you are giving it back to me as credit on my account. I have tried to contact you multiple times and every time you tell me this is correct. I then say that it is not and then you say you will investigate and then never get back to me. This is not good enough and I want my money back as agreed.

Your support staff are useless and avoid getting to resolution "

2024-06-20,1,Property reviews are manipulated,"Property reviews are manipulated and loaded. Clearly biased towards hosts. I posted a bullet pointed statement of dry facts and the host had it deleted.

Do NOT trust the reviews on Airbnb. Almost all properties have 4.5 stars as negative reviews are deleted."
2024-06-20,1,Empty Promises:,"Empty Promises:
I had a fraudulent charge on my credit card from Airbnb. When calling Airbnb, customer service stated they would take care of this matter for me, albeit needed to follow-up with a different department where they would be in-touch with me via email. I spent over 8 hours on the phone, numerous emails and inquirers via their online system over a few months disputing this charge. Not once, was I able to talk with someone from their fraud/claims department (they only communicate via email and send form/scripted email responses). Here's one example: 

""Neethu, Sun, 24 Mar 2024 18:29:12 GMT

Hi xxxxxxxxx,

Thank you for your patience as we looked into your question about a suspected, unauthorized charge on your credit card.

Often, apparent unauthorized charges result from another person (usually a close friend or family member) using your credit card unintentionally. Our investigation into this charge led us to conclude that this is what occurred in this instance.

As a result, we will not be able to refund this charge.

We recommend getting in touch with anyone you may have given your credit card details to in the past. Additionally, we would suggest contacting any friends or family members who have an Airbnb account that you've traveled with on Airbnb previously—if you added your payment credentials on another account and decided to save these credentials for future use, this could be what caused the unexpected charge.

If you have any further questions or concerns, just reply to this message. We're here to help!

Best,
Neethu

Airbnb Community support""
No one at Airbnb would provide supporting documents showing I made a charge, reservation or other. They would not tell me the property ""I booked"" nor the name on the reservation. Airbnb accepted no responsibility, refused to credit my account, nor allow me to talk with anyone with decision making capabilities. Airbnb, why would you steal money from your customers? This is Fraud. Shame on you Airbnb!

Un saludo,

Amazing service - We had issues in 2022 because a GU that was advised we are a naturist place, arrived, we spent some hours showing around and at the end decided to leave with no reasons - Now 2024 we decided to give a new oportunity to Airbnb, got 3 reservations (1500€) and give us 127€ 👀….

How is this even possible??? Tried to explain and solve with CS but this is the result… they ask to call, We answer in the minute, and 15m later: Tomorrow we will call you… 
We have only 5* reviews and Airbnb CS doesn’t mean to care about…

We just reserved our homes for no money… for Airbnb actually…

2024-06-20,1,Very inconvenient stay,"My recent stay at an Airbnb in Dubai managed by Frank Porter was marred by numerous issues that significantly impacted my comfort and convenience.

Firstly, the check-in process was difficult. Despite instructions stating that a Frank Porter team member would check me in, I only received inadequate instructions via message, leaving me confused about parking and building access. The complex parking system and lack of clear guidance added to the frustration. After unsuccessful attempts to contact the host and security, I was only able to enter thanks to another resident.

Once inside, the problems continued. The air conditioning was ineffective, and the old, uncomfortable mattress was only replaced after a week. Other issues included an improperly bolted security safe, a TV that couldn’t connect to Netflix, an insecure shower stand, and water leakage. Additionally, heavy rains caused basement flooding, leading to a persistent sewage odor.

Despite some issues being resolved, I had to temporarily vacate the apartment due to a leak requiring extensive repairs. The relocation process was poorly managed. The alternative apartment didn’t match the provided images, had an occupied parking space, and was in a less desirable area. It lacked amenities, had poor air conditioning, a damaged mattress, and an undesirable bathroom configuration.

After deciding to leave earlier than planned, my request for an early check-out refund was rejected. I also requested to remain in the second apartment to avoid moving again, but this was also denied. Moving back to the original apartment two weeks before my final move-out date was another hassle, with no assistance from Frank Porter. I faced the same initial issue of gaining entry to the building, as Frank Porter did not have an access code.

Despite seeking assistance from Airbnb, their support was inconsistent, and they reneged on a promised refund. This experience has soured me on using Airbnb and I will never stay in a property managed by Frank Porter again."

2024-06-19,1,The host’s property was nothing like…,"The host’s property was nothing like advertised,
Tired ,mould on walls ,kicked in doors, smell of drains 
In the kitchen area ,smashed tv,broken toilet ,unusable outside space,and other safety issues.I complained got no support at all from Airbnb,and the Ambassador for the claims team hung up ,
I’m disgusted that they can get away with this.
Also they use Klarna which is unregulated third party so you can Not do a charge back,
Just look at the ratings 
Eventually got partial refund 
But doesn’t take away the bad experience."
2024-06-19,2,Terribly disappointed in Airbnbs…,"Terribly disappointed in Airbnbs response to a situation of panic that they created as a result of a cancellation for my 40th birthday. I had everything mapped out and planned. When I realised the options they provided were so far from the other place and therefore difficult for my guests to get to. I requested to cancel and reapply their voucher to the new option. I made the change within in an hour but they refused. I have been a great customer but now i'm doubtful of trusting a booking for an important life event via Airbnb. I would be weary. They gave me a bit of a nonsense excuse for not being able to change this. Not a great customer services strategy. I would have thought, you look after loyal customers where you have created the problem."
2024-06-19,1,Appalling service provider,"Appalling service from Airbnb. I had issues with a rented property and they did nothing to help me. We experienced issues with cleanliness, maintenance and the facilities in the property - I took photos to prove everything, and despite providing them, they still didn’t help. They were totally in favour of the host and not the guest. "
2024-06-19,2,Terrible support for hosts,"I'm an Airbnb owner.

Pros: Airbnb does bring in bookings.

Cons: They take too big a cut for what they do and are too greedy.

Support is terrible. Support does an exceptional job of telling me a lot that I don't need to know (from congratulating me on being a superhost every time I make contact [it's patronising and not helpful to hear it time and time again] to feeding me with information I didn't actually ask for), but never actually answering my questions. It's a complete waste of time."
2024-06-19,1,BEWARE,"BEWARE - Airbnb has created a platform that can charge people for receiving no service at all. Due to ill health we could not comply with the cancellation policy and asked for compassion. None was given by the host. The same dates we chose have now been booked by someone else. The host has received double money for our booking (now cancelled) and the next person. I am out of pocket by over £800. This is criminal. In our case they received this money for providing NO service. Airbnb say, this is the policy and it is up to the host. I feel that they need to lean on hosts more that are behaving in an unethical manner. Learnings: Never stay at a host with a strict cancellation policy. Never stay at a place with no reviews or a new host. "
2024-06-18,1,We need to talk about AirBNB. You can not trust this company. Even when you pay a fortune for their service.,"We need to talk about AirBNB. This is such an awful company, is no one seeing it?
Two things. 
First, has anyone noticed what a rip-off Air BNB is? Then why do people keep using it? Hotels are cheaper, plus there are plenty of short term rental sites which offer better alternatives.
Secondly, as I found out, AirBNB is not there for their customers. I don't think many people realise that you really do not have any protection when you book with AirBNB. Again though, this isn't something most people know because quite often the booking is uneventful. But I recently found out myself, I had a bad landlord (of course we are bound to come across them from time-to-time). AirBNB cancelled my booking half way through the 30 day booking - Yes that's right - I was ALREADY STAYING IN THE ACCOMODATION WHEN IT WAS CANCELLED !!! I received a message early in the morning and no one would respond all day, even to give me a reason why this was happening, until finally at night I was forced to go walking the streets to look for somewhere to stay. Yes that's right, Air BNB customer service are really just that awful! 
This is a true story. You can not trust this company. Even when you pay a fortune for their service.


"
2024-06-18,2,Air BNB does not do any verification on…,"Air BNB does not do any verification on the hosts. They do not verify what the host says about their place and once the host gets paid there’s no getting the money back if it’s not as stated. Hosts only post what’s positive about their rental but they don’t tell you any of the negative. For instance, if you need assistance such as an elevator, because you can’t go up the stairs, a host will never tell you that they are on the third floor, and that there is no lift. That is just one example of the negative information that no host will tell you. Another example is if the street in front of the host is under construction and noisy. You will never hear about it from them until it’s too late."
2024-06-18,2,I had a very bad experience with Airbnb…,"I had a very bad experience with Airbnb recently in our visit at London.
Most of the property items were not working.
I complained about these and when i gave a bad review i was told that i need to pay around 200$ for the damage that we have not made.
Airbnb failed to prove that the damage was done by us.
No one would take photos of the entire house and items before and after to be on safe side.it is the airbnb responsibility to compare the property before and after the property was used.
I was forced to pay the fine for the Damage we never did. they just showed us the photos of small marks on a table and said it was done by us. they failed to produce the photos before we rented the house."
